 ------------1 Introduction
In the mid to later part of the 20th century, ﬁnance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the eﬃcient
markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the
ﬁeld on a new, solid scientiﬁc foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were
powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders,
leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset
pricing, eﬃcient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing
to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for
this new ﬁnancial rigor.2In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center
of a change in thinking about ﬁnancial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which
agents may diﬀer in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information,
their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions. Models in the realm of agent-based computational ﬁnance view ﬁnancial markets as interacting groups
of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand
the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would
be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3It is important to distinguish agent-based models
from other more general heterogeneous agent models in ﬁnance, since the latter have been part of the ﬁeld
for some time.4In agent-based ﬁnancial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is
represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a ﬁxed or changing set of strategies. In
principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in
general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form
of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded
rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual
agents. It is also important to remember that the simpliﬁed rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest
that the exercise is forcing some sort of simpliﬁed solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,
1This view is not far oﬀ the more general perspective on information dissemination in the economy as a whole put forth in
Hayek (1945). 2A good early collection of work from this era is Cootner (1964).",Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of computational finance, including the use of computational tools to create models for financial insights and the role of computers in cases where analytic solutions are not feasible."
What is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'?,"Investor heterogeneity refers to the differences in characteristics, preferences, and expectations among investors in the market. It can impact asset pricing models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) when agents have varying beliefs or behaviors. Heterogeneity can be incorporated into models through mean expectations or other factors.","42In Levy et al. (2000) begin to explore some simple multi asset models. Their goal is to begin to understand how well the
predictions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model hold up in heterogeneous agent situations. Their early ﬁndings are supportive
of the CAPM, but the model only allows heterogeneity to enter in a limited way, through mean expectations. 43See Baillie et al. (1996) for an example of a fractionally integrated volatility process. Also, see LeBaron (2001 c) for further
discussion of fractional integration in stock return series. 27

What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?,The revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century involved a shift towards more realistic models of market dynamics. Financial economists began exploring the idea of learning and adapting agents influencing market efficiency. The goal was to move away from stylized equilibrium theories towards a more accurate representation of market behavior.,"Second there is a large amount of ﬁnancial data available for testing. It will be interesting to see if,
sometime in the future, ﬁnancial economists eventually replace the stylized theories of equilibrium market
dynamics with a more realistic picture of the continuing struggle of learning and adapting agents who push
markets in the direction of eﬃciency, even though they never quite reach this goal. 42

Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because they are still debated in terms of market efficiency and rationality. The concept of market efficiency suggests that traders with less than rational strategies will eventually disappear. The unpredictability of financial markets makes them difficult to forecast accurately.,"or is presupposing that markets are not well represented by equilibrium rational stories. However, it is
stressing that rules of thumb need to be built from a foundation of simple adaptive behaviors. Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons. First, the key debates in ﬁnance about market eﬃciency and rationality are still unresolved. Second, ﬁnancial
time series contain many curious puzzles that are not well understood. Third, ﬁnancial markets provide a
wealth of pricing and volume data that can be analyzed. Fourth, when considering evolution, ﬁnancial
markets provide a good approximation to a crude ﬁtness measure through wealth or return performance. Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets. Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market
eﬃciency has a strong theoretical and empirical backing which should not be ignored.5On the theoretical
side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any
predictable components either in their own past series, or connected to fundamentals, the remaining rational
investors will reduce these to zero. This is very close to the evolutionary arguments put forth in both Alchian
(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein
(2001). As appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted
dynamical process describing how market eﬃciency comes about. The second foundation for eﬃcient market
theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization
were brought to bear on these problems.8This led to an even stronger representation for ﬁnancial markets,
the representative agent.9This model formally connects asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate
individual who can then be linked to various state variables of the macroeconomy. 5The ﬁeld has been surveyed many places, but the classic surveys remain Fama (1970) and Fama (1991). 6Examples are in Cootner (1964) and Fama (1970). 7It is also important to note that the radical idea that randomness was a good model for ﬁnancial prices goes back to the
beginning of the 20th century in Bachelier (1900). 8See, for example, Merton (1971), Breedon (1979), and Lucas (1978).

using traditional econometric tools. Agent-based modelers should be aware of these nonlinear issues, and
take them into account when evaluating market simulations. Financial markets are an important challenge for agent-based computational modelers. Financial markets

questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves using the optimal linear functional form for agent i, represented by the formula si=αi(¯d−p). The agents start with this formula but still need to determine the optimal α. The market operates for S periods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period.

The explanation also mentions the need for determining the optimal α and the market operating for S periods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period.
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t p2,t. Agents care about the relative returns of the two currencies, which must be equal in equilibrium. The demand for savings is determined by the agents' maximization problem.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal. Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value. The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency.

Chicago Press, Chicago, IL. Fung, H. G. & Patterson, G.",Incorrect,The answer provided does not directly address the question asked. It discusses agents' maximization problem and demand for savings instead of providing the formula for the exchange rate.
Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Critics of agent-based markets point out the lack of general principles for constructing models and the potential instability when new trading strategies are introduced. Another criticism is the assumption of a small number of assets in most models, limiting the complexity and realism of the simulations. These issues highlight the challenges faced by agent-based modelers in accurately representing financial markets.","Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves. (Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment. This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism. Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well
to models with a single representative risky asset. Questions naturally arise about calibrating to aggregate
dividends, and exactly what this calibration means, since aggregate dividends are not paid by any single
stock. Also, recent events such as the technology bubble of the 1990s remind us that bubbles are often very
sector dependent.

 ------------Unfortunately, this may also make them diﬃcult to estimate
using traditional econometric tools. Agent-based modelers should be aware of these nonlinear issues, and
take them into account when evaluating market simulations. Financial markets are an important challenge for agent-based computational modelers. Financial markets
may be one of the important early areas where agent-based methods show their worth, for two basic reasons. 41",Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the criticisms of agent-based markets, including the lack of general principles for constructing models, potential instability with new trading strategies, and the limitation of complexity due to a small number of assets. It also acknowledges the challenges faced by agent-based modelers in accurately representing financial markets."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an important factor in decision-making processes, such as adjusting prices based on market demand. The impact of timing decisions can be significant in a world of evolving strategies. There is no clear policy rationale for reducing time limits for lodging complaints related to sexual harassment.","The degree to which results depend on
arbitrary timing decisions is deﬁnitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed
price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It
is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the

 There is no sound policy reason for the new time limit . At the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward 
by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate 
unmeritorious  or vexatious  claims being made14. The JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related 
to complaint handling  activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15. However, this 
recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a 
complaint16. Indeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the  
President’s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none 
of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for 
lodging a complaint. There is no evidence which suggest s claims that are mad e more than six months after 
the alleged events took place are less meritorious than those that are made before this 
time period. In fact, to the contrary, it is well documented that victims of sexual harassment may face 
a number of hurdles in bringing a  complaints in short time periods for a number of 
reasons, including the emotional and psychological impact the conduct often has them.17   
 
Of the 17 percent of people who made a complaint to their supervisor, the majority of 
complaints were made shortly a fter the events occurred. The statistics in relation to the 
timing of reporting sexual harassment were set out comprehensively by the AHRC in the 
Fourth Report, and are illustrated in the graph below.",Incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address the question asked. It discusses the importance of timing in decision-making processes and the impact of timing decisions, but does not explain how timing is an ignored final problem.

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces is a persistent issue despite legislation prohibiting it since 1984. The current legislative scheme places the burden on victims to seek redress rather than imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent harassment. This can be particularly challenging for vulnerable groups and contributes to low reporting rates.,"Maurice Blackburn Lawyers submission to the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces . Page 7 
  
i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5. This means that an individual, who may (and often does) have limited access to the law, is 
obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the  AHRC , in order to seek redress. This 
process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without l egal advice. We will return to 
our concerns regarding the current system  in our discussion on the Complaints Process. It can also be daunting for victims who are emotionally distressed, unfamiliar with legal 
processes, fearful of reprisal, and who are un sure of their legal rights. Further, women who 
are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career 
mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9. That means that in 83 percent of cases, the victims did not make a complaint for a whole 
host of reasons. These statistics demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases the current 
legislative scheme  has both failed to prevent the conduct through deterrence, and has failed 
to address the conduct through providing victims with access to an adequate remedy. Under the current scheme, an employer’s obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent 
sexual h arassment only becomes relevant where they are defending a claim of sexual 
harassment  - that is, after the harassment and the harm have already occurred10. Specifically, under s106 of the SDA an employer can escape vicarious liability for sexual 
harassmen t, where it can establish that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the sexual 
harassment from occurring11. 5 Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, P arliament of Australia, Half Way to Equal: Report of the 
Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia  (1992) (‘Halfway to Equal Report’).

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by limiting the understanding of outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. This lack of data hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of the mediation process and make improvements. A more robust approach to mediation is needed to increase settlements and address the slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.,"The Complaints Process  
 
In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants. Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives. Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process  
 
These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to

The Mediation Process  
 
Model of Mediation  
 
The study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald23 found that a number of 
factors influenced the outcome including differences in the manner in which mediators  
conducted the mediation , whether the complainant had found another job and of course 
the level of harm and distress they had suffered. It is our  observation that the approach taken to mediation in the AHRC is for a mediator 
to take a light touch and express no view as to the merits of a claim or, conversely, as to 
the potential liability and risk of a respondent to a claim. In our view, a more rob ust 
approach to mediation  should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at 
mediation. Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.",Correct,The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It highlights the limitations in understanding outcomes and the need for a more robust approach to mediation.
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, according to Maurice Blackburn, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm. They believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace. Maurice Blackburn also suggests that governing bodies should report incidents of sexual harassment to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.","This includes observations on the variou s pieces of legislation which 
make up the current framework, the complaints and appeals processes, and the assistance 
available to victims. The impacts on victims can be life long and life changing. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the signif icant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail 
in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. We believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully 
aware of the incidence of sexual haras sment in their workplace, and that they should be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their 
reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’). We believe that the current legislated tim eframe for making a complaint through AHRC is 
unworkable and out of step with other legislative provisions. It should be amended to 6 years 
in line with other employment law jurisdictions. We believe that the Australian Human Rights 
Commission Act 1986 (th e AHRC Act) or regulations should be amended to expressly 
prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences. We believe that other authorities, such as State and Territory Work, Health and Safety 
regulators, along with trade unions and con sumer advocates, could and should have a 
greater role to play in addressing and stamping out workplace sexual harassment. Above all, we believe that the AHRC should be properly funded and fully staffed in order to 
fulfil its statutory objectives and enab le it to more swiftly and robustly perform its vital role in 
resolving claims of sexual harassment in the workplace. In preparing this submission, Maurice Blackburn has engaged with a number of 
organisations such as NOW Australia and Unions NSW, who share  our goal of preventing 
sexual harassment from occurring in Australian workplaces and securing justice for victims. Specifically, Maurice Blackburn, NOW Australia and Unions NSW hosted a roundtable with

In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized when the abuser intends to cause harm through digital communication, when harm is reasonably expected by the victim, and when serious emotional distress is suffered by the individual. The legislative framework should include regulation and criminal sanctions to hold abusers, employers, and online platforms accountable for enabling or exposing people to online sexual harassment. A civil process should also be in place to provide citizens with the tools needed to seek appropriate redress in cases of online sexual harassment."," Immediacy. Responding to on -line media does not encourage introspection or the 
tempering of language  or behaviour .  The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration. We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages. This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms. We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material. We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress. Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.  That t he statutory body can order that offending materials be removed  from an on -line 
platform , and require a  correction and/or an apology.  That the frameworks allows  for the release of the identity of  anonymous abusers.  That on -line sexual harassment is criminalise d where : 
o the abuser intends a digital communication to cause harm,  
o a person  would reasonably expect the person in the position of the victim to 
be harmed, and

 o the individual suffers serious emotional distress. Our s ubmission s in response to ToR 1 : 
 
Maurice Blackburn submits that changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online 
workplace -related sexual and sex -based harassment  must include enforceable sanctions 
against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. Maurice Blackburn encourages the AHRC  to consider ways that employers can assist in 
creating a workplace where exposure to discus sion and engagement  via social media 
platforms does not impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment. We encourage the AHRC  to reimagin e how a criminal code and  a civil regime to combat on-
line sexual harassment  in Australia might be implemented. We submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it  is 
important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:  
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual 
harassment , and 
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online  
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to  monitor and 
protect users. 2.",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of when online sexual harassment should be criminalized, including the intention to cause harm, the expectation of harm by the victim, and the emotional distress suffered. It also mentions the importance of legislative framework, regulation, criminal sanctions, accountability of abusers, employers, and online platforms, as well as the need for a civil process for seeking redress."
