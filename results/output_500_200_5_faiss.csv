In agent-based financial markets, dynamic heterogeneity plays a critical role in shaping outcomes.

dynamics with a more realistic picture of the continuing struggle of learning and adapting agents who push
markets in the direction of eﬃciency, even though they never quite reach this goal.

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters, with the impact of many parameters not well understood. Another criticism is the lack of guidance in answering basic design questions when constructing these models. Additionally, some models assume a small number of assets, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios.","5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.

 ------------This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism.
Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a

How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is often an ignored final problem in agent-based models and asset pricing models.

A ﬁnal problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump-
tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to
make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In
