What is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'?,"Investor heterogeneity refers to the diversity among investors in terms of their preferences, beliefs, and behaviors in financial markets. This concept recognizes that investors have varying levels of risk tolerance, investment strategies, and decision-making processes. Understanding investor heterogeneity is crucial for analyzing asset pricing and market dynamics.","Hirshleifer, D.

What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?,"The revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century was the development of efficient market theories, particularly the concept of market efficiency and the representative agent model. These ideas were formalized using modern tools of dynamic optimization, connecting asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate individual. Early empirical work on financial markets suggested that markets are more unpredictable than practitioners believe, with the random walk model being a good approximation for stock price movements.","(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein
(2001). As appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted
dynamical process describing how market eﬃciency comes about. The second foundation for eﬃcient market
theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization
were brought to bear on these problems.8This led to an even stronger representation for ﬁnancial markets,
the representative agent.9This model formally connects asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate
individual who can then be linked to various state variables of the macroeconomy.
5The ﬁeld has been surveyed many places, but the classic surveys remain Fama (1970) and Fama (1991).
6Examples are in Cootner (1964) and Fama (1970).
7It is also important to note that the radical idea that randomness was a good model for ﬁnancial prices goes back to the
beginning of the 20th century in Bachelier (1900).
8See, for example, Merton (1971), Breedon (1979), and Lucas (1978).
9Constantinides (1989) is a good example describing the assumptions necessary to get a representative consumer in many
cases. Also, Kirman (1992) critically assesses the use of representative agents in many economic contexts.

Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because the concept of market efficiency suggests that less rational traders will eventually disappear, leaving only rational investors to reduce any predictable components in prices to zero. This idea is supported by theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, such as the random walk model that approximates stock price movements. The representative agent model further formalizes this connection by linking asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate individual in the macroeconomy.","Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets.
Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market
eﬃciency has a strong theoretical and empirical backing which should not be ignored.5On the theoretical
side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any
predictable components either in their own past series, or connected to fundamentals, the remaining rational
investors will reduce these to zero. This is very close to the evolutionary arguments put forth in both Alchian
(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea

Why are the financial markets appealing applications for agent-based methods?,"Financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods due to unresolved debates about market efficiency and rationality, as well as the presence of curious puzzles in financial time series. Additionally, the wealth of pricing and volume data in financial markets allows for thorough analysis. Finally, financial markets provide a good approximation for a fitness measure through wealth or return performance, making them suitable for agent-based methods.","Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons.
First, the key debates in ﬁnance about market eﬃciency and rationality are still unresolved. Second, ﬁnancial
time series contain many curious puzzles that are not well understood. Third, ﬁnancial markets provide a
wealth of pricing and volume data that can be analyzed. Fourth, when considering evolution, ﬁnancial
markets provide a good approximation to a crude ﬁtness measure through wealth or return performance.
Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets.

What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the types of securities to be traded, the presence of fundamental value, and the scope of modeling the economy. Agent preferences, such as mean/variance or constant relative risk aversion, also play a crucial role in decision-making. Balancing realism with complexity in the learning process is essential when considering preferences in agent-based financial markets.","some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.
Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of
securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there
an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very speciﬁc ﬁnancial market? As in any
economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often
more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous
agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building
representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design
question is probably the most important, and the most diﬃcult to give guidance on.
2.1 Preferences
Agent preferences are an important decision that must be made. Questions about preference types are
critical. Should they be simple mean/variance preferences, or standard constant relative risk aversion form?
Also, myopic versus intertemporal preferences is another issue. The latter brings in more realism at a
cost of additional complexity in the learning process. It is also possible that certain behavioral features,
such as loss aversion, should be included. Finally, there may be an argument in certain cases to avoid
preferences altogether, and to concentrate simply on the evolution of speciﬁc behavioral rules. The use of","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the different design questions involved in constructing an agent-based financial market.

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves using a linear functional form for agent i's portfolio, with αi(¯d−p) as the formula. Agents learn the optimal α parameter over time through a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm involves fitness estimation, selection, crossover, and mutation operations to optimize agent parameters.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)
Then a new population of length Jis drawn from the old, with probability piassigned to each type. This
new population is now the basis for the crossover and mutation operators in the GA. Each new rule is
crossed with another rule chosen at random according to a ﬁxed crossover probability. Crossover chooses a
midpoint in each of the two bitstrings, and then combines the ﬁrst substring of one rule, with the second
substring of another rule. This new set of rules is then mutated, where each bit is ﬂipped according to a
ﬁxed probability. In Lettau’s framework the mutation rate is slowly decayed over time, so that eventually
mutation probabilities go to zero. This is a form of cooling down the learning rates as time progresses. After
mutation, the new population is ready to go back to purchasing the risky asset for another Speriods before
the GA is run again.
Lettau’s results show that in various speciﬁcations the GA can learn the optimal parameter for the","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","[""The student has provided a clear explanation of Lettau's framework, including the use of a linear functional form and the genetic algorithm for parameter optimization."", ""The student has provided a clear explanation of Lettau's framework, including the use of a linear functional form and the optimization process through a genetic algorithm.

The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by the formula et=p1,t/p2,t. Agents care about the relative returns of the two currencies, which must be equal in equilibrium. The demand for savings is determined by the agents' maximization problem.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal.
Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.
The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency. This setup avoids some of the complexities that appear in other papers in ﬁnding prices.
The evolution of strategies is similar to Lettau (1997). The ﬁtness of a strategy is determined by its","['Incorrect', 'Correct', 'Incorrect']","[""The answer provided does not directly address the question asked.

The formula for exchange rate should be explicitly stated without additional information about agents' maximization problem or demand for savings.""]"
Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Critics of agent-based markets point out the lack of general principles for constructing different models, which may improve over time. Another criticism is the stability of results when new trading strategies are introduced, raising concerns about potential exploitation of market dynamics. Additionally, the assumption of a small number of assets in agent-based financial market models limits the complexity and may overlook important features.","Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves.
(Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment.
This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism.
Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well
to models with a single representative risky asset. Questions naturally arise about calibrating to aggregate","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a thorough discussion of the criticisms of agent-based markets, highlighting the lack of general principles for constructing models, concerns about stability when new trading strategies are introduced, and limitations due to the assumption of a small number of assets.

How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an ignored final problem in complaints of discrimination and harassment, with a slow rate of resolution causing fatigue and distress for complainants. Maurice Blackburn suggests amending the AHRC Act to set time frames for mediation conferences to address this issue. They also propose making respondent participation in the mediation process mandatory to prevent further trauma for claimants.","is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in 
dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment matters, Maurice Blackburn is of t he 
view that a higher level of certainty with respect to how the mediation  conferences are 
conducted  should be given to complainants.  
 
Currently, participation in the mediation  process with the AHRC is voluntary for 
respondents. In our observation this le ads to claimants being further traumatised by the 
actions of their employers  - who either do not file a response or do not attend mediation  
or prevaricate regarding same .  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that in order to encourage respondents and employe rs 
to participate in the mediation  process in meaningful, constructive and useful way, the 
AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the 
mediation  conference and to file a reply document in a specified period of time.

What are the standard rules of a golf game?,I don't know.,"A second important innovation is the use of a common pool of rules, which the authors refer to as a
“business school.” This allows for some strategy learning to occur across agents in a very natural way.38
The rules in the common pool are evolved according to forecast accuracy. Traders then decide to update
their own strategies based on current performance. They draw rules from the common pool, comparing their
performance with their current rules. If the new rule is better they switch, but if they are unsuccessful after
several tries, they quit and stay with their current rule.
Simulations of this ﬁnancial market display some features of actual return time series. They exhibit fat
tails, and visually they do not settle down to any price level. However, there are several features that disagree
with the actual data. For example, there is a large level of positive skew. Also, the linearly ﬁltered return
series are independent, which indicates there may be no persistent eﬀects in volatility. Another interesting
feature that the authors test for is a unit root in the price series. The standard tests cannot reject a unit
root. This is a little curious since the dividend process is stationary. It is probably sensible that in the long
run prices should not diverge too far from the fundamental, and should therefore also be stationary.
Another ﬁnancial market model is the Genoa artiﬁcial market, Raberto, Cincotti, Focardi & Marchesi
(2001). In the original version of their market model the authors used random-order selection, meaning that
buy and sell limit orders are generated at random by traders. Traders ﬁrst determine whether they are a
buyer or seller at random, and then place a limit buy or sell order determined by their budget constraints.
These limit prices in each case are generated as random variables. In contrast to the previous markets, these
traders are generally fairly unsophisticated. As in the study by Cont & Bouchaud (2000) they exhibit a kind","['Incorrect', 'Incorrect', 'Incorrect']","['The answer provided does not demonstrate an understanding of the standard rules of a golf game.

How do you think the token gifts motivate the speakers?,"The token gifts motivate the speakers by providing a reward for their participation in the event. This can create a sense of appreciation and recognition for their efforts. Additionally, token gifts can serve as an incentive for speakers to perform well and engage with the audience.","Then a mutation operator is applied to all rules.
The investors are encoded as bitstrings. The two investors maintain a price table that indicates the price
that they will pay for each possible security. The investor has a table of 80 possible pricing strategies for
each security. In each round, each investor choses a pricing strategy at random from the appropriate security
table after the ﬁrm has decided on the security that it will issue.52The security goes to the highest bidder in
each round. The proﬁtability of the strategy from the investor’s perspective is recorded, and the populations
are adjusted with a selection procedure in which the 10 worst strategies are replaced by the 10 best. At this
point the GA is applied to the population with crossover, mutation, and the election operator.
The authors then run this simulation for many rounds and in many diﬀerent design situations. One of the
most interesting results comes from the choice of securities. Experiments are performed that try to separate
out the joint learning processes. Firms play against a ﬁxed set of investors who know the appropriate pricing
functions. In this situation equity and subordinated debt dominate the market, and straight debt is rarely
used in stark contrast to the real world. When learning is allowed for both parties, debt moves to becoming
the most commonly used security, with subordinated debt next, and equity third. This shows the importance
of the coevolutionary learning dynamic. In this world the preponderance of debt may have more to do with
the ability of ﬁrms to learn how to price this relatively simple security, and the ensuing positive feedback
this has on the issuance decision. Several other results from the model are also interesting. Investors tend
to systematically underprice the securities in all cases. Also, the situation where the ﬁrm is not able to raise
suﬃcient investment funds actually occurs more often with two-sided learning than investor-only learning.","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a clear explanation of how token gifts motivate the speakers by rewarding their participation, creating a sense of appreciation and recognition, and serving as an incentive for performance and engagement.', 'The answer provides a clear explanation of how token gifts motivate the speakers by rewarding their participation, creating a sense of appreciation and recognition, and serving as an incentive for performance and engagement.', 'The answer provides a clear explanation of how token gifts motivate the speakers by rewarding their participation, creating a sense of appreciation and recognition, and serving as an incentive for performance and engagement.']"

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,"Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces persists despite legislation prohibiting it. The current system places the burden on victims to seek redress, which can be difficult and daunting. Vulnerable groups, such as those with low economic status or limited career mobility, are among the most affected.","Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5.  
 
This means that an individual, who may (and often does) have limited access to the law, is 
obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the  AHRC , in order to seek redress. This 
process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without l egal advice. We will return to 
our concerns regarding the current system  in our discussion on the Complaints Process.   
 
It can also be daunting for victims who are emotionally distressed, unfamiliar with legal 
processes, fearful of reprisal, and who are un sure of their legal rights. Further, women who 
are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career 
mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. 
 
Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9.","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a clear explanation of how sexual harassment is peculiar to Australian workplaces, highlighting the persistence of the issue despite legislation and the challenges faced by victims, especially vulnerable groups.', 'The answer provides a clear explanation of how sexual harassment is peculiar to Australian workplaces, highlighting the persistence of the issue despite legislation and the challenges faced by victims, especially vulnerable groups.', 'The answer provides a clear explanation of how sexual harassment is peculiar to Australian workplaces by mentioning the persistence of the issue despite legislation, the burden on victims to seek redress, and the impact on vulnerable groups.']"
What legislative suggestions pertaining to workplace sexual harassment does the firm provide in its submission?,"The firm suggests implementing mandatory training on sexual harassment prevention for all employees. They also recommend establishing clear reporting procedures and support mechanisms for victims of harassment. Additionally, they propose stricter penalties for perpetrators of workplace sexual harassment.","Submission in Response

Sexual Harassment in

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations can impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process by hindering the ability to identify key factors influencing outcomes. This lack of information may lead to a less robust approach to mediation, potentially affecting settlement rates. Implementing time frames for scheduling mediation conferences could help address delays and improve the overall process for complainants.","Model of Mediation  
 
The study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald23 found that a number of 
factors influenced the outcome including differences in the manner in which mediators  
conducted the mediation , whether the complainant had found another job and of course 
the level of harm and distress they had suffered.  
 
It is our  observation that the approach taken to mediation in the AHRC is for a mediator 
to take a light touch and express no view as to the merits of a claim or, conversely, as to 
the potential liability and risk of a respondent to a claim. In our view, a more rob ust 
approach to mediation  should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at 
mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in 
dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment matters, Maurice Blackburn is of t he 
view that a higher level of certainty with respect to how the mediation  conferences are 
conducted  should be given to complainants.","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations can impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process.

What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, according to Maurice Blackburn, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for harm suffered rather than obligating employers to prevent harm in the first place.

mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. 
 
Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9.  
 
That means that in 83 percent of cases, the victims did not make a complaint for a whole 
host of reasons. These statistics demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases the current 
legislative scheme  has both failed to prevent the conduct through deterrence, and has failed 
to address the conduct through providing victims with access to an adequate remedy.","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a clear explanation of one significant failing of the current legislative scheme, which is the onus placed on victims to seek redress instead of obligating employers to prevent harm.

In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where particularly nefarious behaviors are involved, and when individuals, employers, or social media platforms enable or expose others to such harassment. A legislative framework should incorporate regulation, criminal sanctions, and civil remedies to hold abusers and enablers accountable. It is important to provide resources to law enforcement agencies to successfully prosecute those engaging in online sexual harassment."," The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material.  
 
We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.  
 
Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.  
 
 That t he statutory body can order that offending materials be removed  from an on -line 
platform , and require a  correction and/or an apology.","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of when online sexual harassment should be criminalized, mentioning nefarious behaviors, enabling individuals/employers/platforms, legislative framework with regulation, criminal sanctions, civil remedies, and resources for law enforcement agencies.
