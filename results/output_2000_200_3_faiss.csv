 ------------to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for
this new ﬁnancial rigor.2In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center
of a change in thinking about ﬁnancial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which
agents may diﬀer in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information,
their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.
Models in the realm of agent-based computational ﬁnance view ﬁnancial markets as interacting groups
of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand
the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would
be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3It is important to distinguish agent-based models
from other more general heterogeneous agent models in ﬁnance, since the latter have been part of the ﬁeld
for some time.4In agent-based ﬁnancial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is
represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a ﬁxed or changing set of strategies. In
principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in
general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form
of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded
rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual
agents. It is also important to remember that the simpliﬁed rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest

 ------------Joshi (2002) the authors use U.S. aggregate real dividends interpolated to daily frequencies as a fundamental
input into market with heterogeneous value investors and trend followers. Their ﬁnancial market model
generates reasonable long swings away from the fundamental pricing as well as uncorrelated daily returns.
It also generates most of the important empirical features described in previous sections, including, fat tails,
volatility persistence, and trading volume persistence. The model also oﬀers interesting tractability since it
is built from a foundation of realistic trading strategies.
LeBaron (2001 a) and LeBaron (2002 a) perform some extensive calibration exercises. These exercises are
based on an agent-based model presented in LeBaron (2001 b). This model combines several features of the
models mentioned previously. It uses a neural network structure to represent trader portfolio strategies.
In this model traders do not build forecasts. The neural network maps past information directly into a
recommended portfolio holding directly, and thus avoids the intermediate step of mapping a forecast into a
portfolio policy. It also avoids having to estimate the return variance using a separate volatility equation.
Traders are deﬁned by heterogeneous memory lengths as in Levy et al. (1994). Some traders evaluate
strategies using a short past history of returns, while others use longer histories. Also, the preferences for
the agents are constant relative risk aversion, so agents with more wealth control a larger fraction of the
market. The strategy population evolves separately from the traders; the traders choose strategies perceived
to be optimal based on time series with lengths corresponding to the traders’ memory lengths. This has
some similarities to the social learning mechanisms in Chen & Yeh (2001). The strategies are evolved using
a modiﬁed genetic algorithm designed to respect the neural network architecture. Finally, the economic

 ------------heterogeneous agent types. However, the traders in Levy et al. (1994) do not form complicated strategies and
predictors. Traders maximize a one-period myopic utility function exhibiting constant relative risk aversion
rather than constant absolute risk aversion. This technical change is important in that now agents’ impact
on prices depend on their relative wealth levels.
The economic foundations of the model are similar to other agent-based ﬁnancial markets. There is a
risk-free asset which pays a constant interest rate. There is a risky stock paying a random dividend that
follows a multiplicative random walk,
dt+1=dt(1 +zt+1), (23)
where ztis drawn from a well-deﬁned distribution designed to roughly replicate actual dividend growth.
The market consists of several types of traders. There are fundamental traders who possess a model for
pricing the stock based on the dividend fundamental. They use this to predict the future price, and to then
set their optimal portfolio fraction accordingly. A second, and more important, type for this model uses past
information only to determine its current portfolio. This trader looks at the past mperiods of returns, and
ﬁnds what fraction of stock and bond holdings would have been optimal over this period. This is a kind of
memory length for traders. It allows for some to believe that only a short period of the past is necessary for
forecasting, and others to a believe a much longer series is necessary. The short-memory types represent a
kind of short-term trader who is only interested in the latest fads and who believes the older returns data
are irrelevant.40The memory length history of past returns is used to make a portfolio recommendation for
the next period. There is often a population of these traders with many diﬀerent memory lengths.
The authors progressively add richer sets of the heterogeneous memory traders who trade along side the","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of investor heterogeneity, covering the presence of different types of traders, their strategies, preferences, and the impact on market dynamics and asset pricing.', 'The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of investor heterogeneity, covering the presence of different types of traders in the market with varying strategies, preferences, memory lengths, risk aversion levels, and forecasting approaches.

What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?,"The revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century was the debate on market efficiency and rationality, with unresolved key debates and puzzles in financial time series. The concept of market efficiency has strong theoretical and empirical support, but there is no accepted dynamical process describing how market efficiency comes about. The early ideas of efficient markets were formalized with modern tools of dynamic optimization, leading to the representative agent model connecting asset prices to the beliefs of an aggregate individual.","(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein
(2001). As appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted
dynamical process describing how market eﬃciency comes about. The second foundation for eﬃcient market
theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization
were brought to bear on these problems.8This led to an even stronger representation for ﬁnancial markets,
the representative agent.9This model formally connects asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate
individual who can then be linked to various state variables of the macroeconomy.
5The ﬁeld has been surveyed many places, but the classic surveys remain Fama (1970) and Fama (1991).
6Examples are in Cootner (1964) and Fama (1970).
7It is also important to note that the radical idea that randomness was a good model for ﬁnancial prices goes back to the
beginning of the 20th century in Bachelier (1900).
8See, for example, Merton (1971), Breedon (1979), and Lucas (1978).
9Constantinides (1989) is a good example describing the assumptions necessary to get a representative consumer in many
cases. Also, Kirman (1992) critically assesses the use of representative agents in many economic contexts.

 ------------time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets.
Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market
eﬃciency has a strong theoretical and empirical backing which should not be ignored.5On the theoretical
side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any
predictable components either in their own past series, or connected to fundamentals, the remaining rational
investors will reduce these to zero. This is very close to the evolutionary arguments put forth in both Alchian
(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein

What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the types of securities to be traded, establishing fundamental values, and deciding on the scope of modeling (macro economy or specific financial market). Agent preferences, such as mean/variance or constant relative risk aversion, and myopic versus intertemporal preferences, are critical decisions that impact the realism and complexity of the market. Behavioral features like loss aversion may also need to be considered in the design process.","some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.
Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of
securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves agents using the optimal linear functional form si=αi(¯d−p) to determine their portfolios. Agents are parameterized with a bitstring encoding for their strategies, αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L j=1µj,i2j−1 2L−1. The genetic algorithm in Lettau's framework involves fitness proportional selection, crossover, and mutation operators to learn the optimal parameter for the portfolio strategy.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)
Then a new population of length Jis drawn from the old, with probability piassigned to each type. This
new population is now the basis for the crossover and mutation operators in the GA. Each new rule is
crossed with another rule chosen at random according to a ﬁxed crossover probability. Crossover chooses a
midpoint in each of the two bitstrings, and then combines the ﬁrst substring of one rule, with the second
substring of another rule. This new set of rules is then mutated, where each bit is ﬂipped according to a
ﬁxed probability. In Lettau’s framework the mutation rate is slowly decayed over time, so that eventually
mutation probabilities go to zero. This is a form of cooling down the learning rates as time progresses. After
mutation, the new population is ready to go back to purchasing the risky asset for another Speriods before
the GA is run again.
Lettau’s results show that in various speciﬁcations the GA can learn the optimal parameter for the

 ------------3.2 Model dynamics under learning
The papers described in this section are more computational than those mentioned previously. In most
cases the small sets of tractable trading rules are replaced with larger sets of strategies, which are usually
represented using various computational techniques. These will be referred to as many-type models. This
ﬁrst section concentrates on applications where the economic environment is well understood and where there
is often a simple homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium which gives a useful benchmark comparison.
Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement.
The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in
a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model
with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously
given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth
of agents is given by,
w=s(d−p), (2)
and their preferences are assumed to exhibit constant absolute risk aversion which can be parameterized as
in,
U(w) =−e−γw. (3)
This is clearly a very simpliﬁed market. No attempt is made to look at the feedback from agents’ demands
to returns on the risky asset. There is no consumption, and wealth is not linked to agents’ impact on asset
prices, or evolution. However, it is a very straightforward test of learning in a ﬁnancial market.

The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.
The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency. This setup avoids some of the complexities that appear in other papers in ﬁnding prices.

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Critics of agent-based markets point out the lack of general principles for constructing models and the potential instability when new trading strategies are introduced. Additionally, the criticism includes the assumption of a small number of assets in most agent-based financial market models, limiting the complexity and realism of the models. These criticisms highlight the need for further development and consideration of more diverse and dynamic market conditions in agent-based modeling.","Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves.
(Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment.
This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism.
Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well
to models with a single representative risky asset. Questions naturally arise about calibrating to aggregate

stock. Also, recent events such as the technology bubble of the 1990s remind us that bubbles are often very
sector dependent. Finally, when thinking about trading volume, it is really necessary to have a multi-asset

 There is no sound policy reason for the new time limit . 
 
At the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward 
by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate 
unmeritorious  or vexatious  claims being made14.  
 
The JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related 
to complaint handling  activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15. However, this 
recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a 
complaint16.  
 
Indeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the  
President’s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none 
of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for 
lodging a complaint.  
 
There is no evidence which suggest s claims that are mad e more than six months after 
the alleged events took place are less meritorious than those that are made before this 
time period.  
 
In fact, to the contrary, it is well documented that victims of sexual harassment may face 
a number of hurdles in bringing a  complaints in short time periods for a number of 
reasons, including the emotional and psychological impact the conduct often has them.17   
 
Of the 17 percent of people who made a complaint to their supervisor, the majority of 
complaints were made shortly a fter the events occurred. The statistics in relation to the 
timing of reporting sexual harassment were set out comprehensively by the AHRC in the 
Fourth Report, and are illustrated in the graph below.

 ------------The Student Liaison Committee had another successful year in attracting schools from the Pacific 
Northwest to compete in the Oregon Section's annual Traffic Bowl Competition. The Traffic Bowl is 
a Jeopardy-based trivia contest where students must answer ques tions on a variety of traffic and 
transportation trivia. This year the competition was held on Novem ber 15, 2007 at McMenamin's 
Edgefield just east of Portland, Oregon.  
This year we had 52 students from six universities attending the event. Par ticipating schools were: 
/square4 Portland State University 
/square4 University of Idaho 
/square4 University of Portland 
/square4 Oregon State University 
/square4 University of Washington 
/square4 Oregon Institute of Technology 
 
University of Portland took home the grand prize of bragging rights , a trophy and a $400 scholarship 
award. University of Washington and Oregon Institute of Technology  both received $300 for tying 
for second place.  The remaining three participating schools rec eived a $150 participation award.  All 
of the student attendees received a free dinner at this ev ent. In order to offset the cost of the student 
meals and scholarships, several local companies donated funds to  support student attendance. 
Donations were received from: Advanced Traffic Products, CH2M Hil l, City of Gresham, City of 
Portland, Coral Sales Company, David Evans and Associates, DKS As sociates, Group Mackenzie, 
HDR, IBI Group, JRH Engineering, Kittelson and Associates, Lancaste r Engineering, NWS Traffic 
Engineering, Parametrix, Quality Counts, TrafStats, URS Corp, W&H Pacific, and Western Systems.  
The Oregon Section has already secured the room for Traffic Bowl  2008 (November, 2008) at 
McMenamin’s Edgefield. 
 
This year, students continued to enjoy substantial discounts at  Oregon ITE Section meetings ranging 
from free (Traffic Bowl) to $5 (Section Meetings) depending on t he actual cost of the event and level 
of corporate sponsorship.","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The student correctly identified that it is a departure from the College stop after 5:00 pm and provided additional information about the bus leaving at 5:20 pm.', 'The student correctly identified that it is a departure from the College stop after 5:00 pm and provided additional information about the bus leaving at 5:20 pm.', 'The answer provided correctly states that it is a departure from the College stop after 5:00 pm and specifies the time as 5:20 pm.']"

 ------------The Student Liaison Committee had another successful year in attracting schools from the Pacific 
Northwest to compete in the Oregon Section's annual Traffic Bowl Competition. The Traffic Bowl is 
a Jeopardy-based trivia contest where students must answer ques tions on a variety of traffic and 
transportation trivia. This year the competition was held on Novem ber 15, 2007 at McMenamin's 
Edgefield just east of Portland, Oregon.  
This year we had 52 students from six universities attending the event. Par ticipating schools were: 
/square4 Portland State University 
/square4 University of Idaho 
/square4 University of Portland 
/square4 Oregon State University 
/square4 University of Washington 
/square4 Oregon Institute of Technology 
 
University of Portland took home the grand prize of bragging rights , a trophy and a $400 scholarship 
award. University of Washington and Oregon Institute of Technology  both received $300 for tying 
for second place.  The remaining three participating schools rec eived a $150 participation award.  All 
of the student attendees received a free dinner at this ev ent. In order to offset the cost of the student 
meals and scholarships, several local companies donated funds to  support student attendance. 
Donations were received from: Advanced Traffic Products, CH2M Hil l, City of Gresham, City of 
Portland, Coral Sales Company, David Evans and Associates, DKS As sociates, Group Mackenzie, 
HDR, IBI Group, JRH Engineering, Kittelson and Associates, Lancaste r Engineering, NWS Traffic 
Engineering, Parametrix, Quality Counts, TrafStats, URS Corp, W&H Pacific, and Western Systems.  
The Oregon Section has already secured the room for Traffic Bowl  2008 (November, 2008) at 
McMenamin’s Edgefield. 
 
This year, students continued to enjoy substantial discounts at  Oregon ITE Section meetings ranging 
from free (Traffic Bowl) to $5 (Section Meetings) depending on t he actual cost of the event and level 
of corporate sponsorship.","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides the specific time (5:00 pm) for the last opportunity to take the express bus from the college campus to downtown, which directly addresses the question asked.', 'The answer provides the specific time (5:00 pm) for the last opportunity to take the express bus from the college campus to downtown, which directly addresses the question asked.', 'The answer provided correctly states that the last opportunity to take the express bus from the college campus to downtown is at 5:00 pm.']"

How do you think the donations from the local companies help in offseting the cost of the student meals and scholarships in the competition?,"Donations from local companies help offset the cost of student meals and scholarships by providing financial support for student attendance at the competition. The funds received from companies like Advanced Traffic Products, CH2M Hill, and others contribute to covering the expenses associated with the event. This support allows students to participate in the Traffic Bowl Competition and benefit from the scholarships and meals provided.","The Student Liaison Committee had another successful year in attracting schools from the Pacific 
Northwest to compete in the Oregon Section's annual Traffic Bowl Competition. The Traffic Bowl is 
a Jeopardy-based trivia contest where students must answer ques tions on a variety of traffic and 
transportation trivia. This year the competition was held on Novem ber 15, 2007 at McMenamin's 
Edgefield just east of Portland, Oregon.  
This year we had 52 students from six universities attending the event. Par ticipating schools were: 
/square4 Portland State University 
/square4 University of Idaho 
/square4 University of Portland 
/square4 Oregon State University 
/square4 University of Washington 
/square4 Oregon Institute of Technology 
 
University of Portland took home the grand prize of bragging rights , a trophy and a $400 scholarship 
award. University of Washington and Oregon Institute of Technology  both received $300 for tying 
for second place.  The remaining three participating schools rec eived a $150 participation award.  All 
of the student attendees received a free dinner at this ev ent. In order to offset the cost of the student 
meals and scholarships, several local companies donated funds to  support student attendance. 
Donations were received from: Advanced Traffic Products, CH2M Hil l, City of Gresham, City of 
Portland, Coral Sales Company, David Evans and Associates, DKS As sociates, Group Mackenzie, 
HDR, IBI Group, JRH Engineering, Kittelson and Associates, Lancaste r Engineering, NWS Traffic 
Engineering, Parametrix, Quality Counts, TrafStats, URS Corp, W&H Pacific, and Western Systems.  
The Oregon Section has already secured the room for Traffic Bowl  2008 (November, 2008) at 
McMenamin’s Edgefield. 
 
This year, students continued to enjoy substantial discounts at  Oregon ITE Section meetings ranging 
from free (Traffic Bowl) to $5 (Section Meetings) depending on t he actual cost of the event and level 
of corporate sponsorship.

 ------------The Oregon Section maintained and enhanced the solid financial position that had been developed 
over the past several years. The Oregon Section has signed up for  online banking and uses a check 
card for most routine expenditures. Payments and account inquirie s are processed faster and the 
overall number of reimbursement checks are reduced significantly.   
Most monthly functions for the 2007-08 fiscal year have either broken even or in the case of the 
January Technical Workshop have had a net income due to better than a verage attendance. This can 
be attributed to interesting topics, user-friendly and informati ve web site as well as the hard work of 
Section officers and volunteers. The remainder of this page summar izes the Section’s 2007-2008 
finances.

What are the standard rules of a golf game?,I don't know.,"A second important innovation is the use of a common pool of rules, which the authors refer to as a
“business school.” This allows for some strategy learning to occur across agents in a very natural way.38
The rules in the common pool are evolved according to forecast accuracy. Traders then decide to update
their own strategies based on current performance. They draw rules from the common pool, comparing their
performance with their current rules. If the new rule is better they switch, but if they are unsuccessful after
several tries, they quit and stay with their current rule.
Simulations of this ﬁnancial market display some features of actual return time series. They exhibit fat
tails, and visually they do not settle down to any price level. However, there are several features that disagree
with the actual data. For example, there is a large level of positive skew. Also, the linearly ﬁltered return
series are independent, which indicates there may be no persistent eﬀects in volatility. Another interesting
feature that the authors test for is a unit root in the price series. The standard tests cannot reject a unit
root. This is a little curious since the dividend process is stationary. It is probably sensible that in the long
run prices should not diverge too far from the fundamental, and should therefore also be stationary.
Another ﬁnancial market model is the Genoa artiﬁcial market, Raberto, Cincotti, Focardi & Marchesi
(2001). In the original version of their market model the authors used random-order selection, meaning that
buy and sell limit orders are generated at random by traders. Traders ﬁrst determine whether they are a
buyer or seller at random, and then place a limit buy or sell order determined by their budget constraints.
These limit prices in each case are generated as random variables. In contrast to the previous markets, these
traders are generally fairly unsophisticated. As in the study by Cont & Bouchaud (2000) they exhibit a kind

 ------------Then a mutation operator is applied to all rules.
The investors are encoded as bitstrings. The two investors maintain a price table that indicates the price
that they will pay for each possible security. The investor has a table of 80 possible pricing strategies for
each security. In each round, each investor choses a pricing strategy at random from the appropriate security
table after the ﬁrm has decided on the security that it will issue.52The security goes to the highest bidder in
each round. The proﬁtability of the strategy from the investor’s perspective is recorded, and the populations
are adjusted with a selection procedure in which the 10 worst strategies are replaced by the 10 best. At this
point the GA is applied to the population with crossover, mutation, and the election operator.
The authors then run this simulation for many rounds and in many diﬀerent design situations. One of the
most interesting results comes from the choice of securities. Experiments are performed that try to separate
out the joint learning processes. Firms play against a ﬁxed set of investors who know the appropriate pricing
functions. In this situation equity and subordinated debt dominate the market, and straight debt is rarely
used in stark contrast to the real world. When learning is allowed for both parties, debt moves to becoming
the most commonly used security, with subordinated debt next, and equity third. This shows the importance
of the coevolutionary learning dynamic. In this world the preponderance of debt may have more to do with
the ability of ﬁrms to learn how to price this relatively simple security, and the ensuing positive feedback
this has on the issuance decision. Several other results from the model are also interesting. Investors tend
to systematically underprice the securities in all cases. Also, the situation where the ﬁrm is not able to raise
suﬃcient investment funds actually occurs more often with two-sided learning than investor-only learning.","['Incorrect', 'Incorrect', 'Incorrect']","['The answer provided does not demonstrate an understanding of the standard rules of a golf game.

How do you think the token gifts motivate the speakers?,"The token gifts motivate the speakers by providing a reward for their participation in the simulation. This incentivizes them to actively engage in the learning process and make strategic decisions. The token gifts also serve as a form of positive reinforcement, encouraging the speakers to continue contributing to the experiment.","Then a mutation operator is applied to all rules.

 ------------continues to progress to higher ﬁtness levels.
Arifovic analyzes the dynamics of this market for various parameter values. The results show that the
ﬁrst-period consumption level converges to a stable value close to the optimum. However, the exchange rate
continues to move over time, never settling to any constant value. There is an interesting interpretation
for this dynamic price process. In the equilibrium the return on the two assets is the same, so the learning
agents are indiﬀerent between holding the two currencies. Groups of agents move to holding one currency or
another, the exchange rate moves around as they shift demands between currencies. In a model such as this,
it is clear that a constant exchange rate equilibrium can only be maintained through some mechanism that
shuts down learning and exploration in the model. Arifovic also shows that similar features are obtained in
experimental markets.30
Routledge (2001) also critically examines what happens when leaning agents are introduced into a well-
known model. He implements GA learning in a version of the heterogeneous information model of Grossman
& Stiglitz (1980). This is a repeated version of a model where agents can purchase a costly signal about
a future dividend payout of a stock. Learning takes place as agents try to convert the noisy signal into a
forecast of future dividends. Agents who decide not to purchase the signal must use the current price to
infer the future dividend payout. Individual agent representations encode not just the decision on whether
to purchase the signal but also the linear forecast parameters which convert the signal into a conditional
expectation of the future dividend payout.
Grossman & Stiglitz (1980) show that there is an equilibrium in which a certain fraction of agents will
purchase the signal. Routledge (2001) shows that this can be supported in the GA learning environment.

 ------------the two investors. Both the ﬁrm and investors encode their strategies as bitstrings for use with a GA. The
ﬁrm maintains a pool of 80 potential security issue decisions which is a vector of numbers (binary coded)
between one and six corresponding to the six types of securities. The ﬁrm will chose one of these at random
each period. The ﬁtness of a strategy is updated with the realized cash ﬂow received by the ﬁrm after the
investment project has been completed and the investors have been paid. Evolution takes place by replacing
all the rules that encode the least proﬁtable strategies with rules that encode the most proﬁtable strategy.
Then a mutation operator is applied to all rules.

that they will pay for each possible security. The investor has a table of 80 possible pricing strategies for
each security. In each round, each investor choses a pricing strategy at random from the appropriate security
table after the ﬁrm has decided on the security that it will issue.52The security goes to the highest bidder in
each round. The proﬁtability of the strategy from the investor’s perspective is recorded, and the populations
are adjusted with a selection procedure in which the 10 worst strategies are replaced by the 10 best. At this
point the GA is applied to the population with crossover, mutation, and the election operator.
The authors then run this simulation for many rounds and in many diﬀerent design situations. One of the
most interesting results comes from the choice of securities. Experiments are performed that try to separate
out the joint learning processes. Firms play against a ﬁxed set of investors who know the appropriate pricing
functions. In this situation equity and subordinated debt dominate the market, and straight debt is rarely
used in stark contrast to the real world. When learning is allowed for both parties, debt moves to becoming","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a clear explanation of how token gifts motivate the speakers by rewarding their participation, incentivizing active engagement, and serving as positive reinforcement.

How was the District 6 meeting a huge success?,"The District 6 meeting was a huge success with over 500 attendees. The event was well-organized and included technical sessions, a student competition, and poster sessions. The meeting attracted a large number of participants and was chaired by Peter Koonce.","September 21, 2007. The tournament drew 57 competitors fro m across the state. The golf event was held at 
Oregon Golf Association (OGA) in Woodburn, Oregon.  This location is approximately 30 miles south of 
Portland. Turnout was good, exceeding last year’s a ttendance, and it was a fun and entertaining event.  In 
addition to volunteers, Lancaster Engineering, Davi d Evans & Associates, DKS Associates, Quality 
Counts, Parsons Brinkerhoff, Inc., Kittelson & Asso ciates, Inc., All Traffic Data Services, TrafStats,  
Western Systems and NW Signal sponsored the event. 
 
Speaker Appreciation Gifts: 
It is the Oregon Section’s tradition to recognize the speaker a t the Monthly Section Meetings and 
various other guests of the Section by presenting them with a token gift. USB thumb drives printed 
with an Oregon ITE logo were purchased as speaker gifts this year, as were handmade coffee mugs 
with the Oregon ITE logo. 
 
District 6 Meeting - Local Arrangements Committee: 
The Oregon Section helped arrange the 2007 District 6 (now Western District) m eeting that was held 
July 15 to 18 in Portland.  This meeting was combined with the Quad Conference to expand  the reach 
of this event to our friends in Vancouver, BC. The Quad meeting was originally s cheduled to take 
place in 2008 in Portland, but the Oregon Section swapped meeting years with the  Vancouver Island 
Section in order to better coordinate the district and quad meetings (a w in-win situation for both 
Sections). 
The District 6 meeting was a huge success in that it attracted over 500 at tendees. The committee, 
chaired by Peter Koonce, was responsible for setting up a great techni cal and social event for the 
members of District 6. Some of the highlights include:

That the AHRC recommend a process for formally requiring that reporting of sexual

That businesses should also be required to report on the number of reported incidents of 
sexual harassment , as part of their reporting requirements to WG EA. 
 
That the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill  (2017) should be repealed and that the 
time for making complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other discrimination 
jurisdictions.  
 
That the time limit imposed by s46PH(b) of the AHRC Act should be abolished, especially 
with respect to sexual  harassment complaints.  
 
That AHRC explore the insertion of statutory criteria to be taken into account by the Courts

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,"Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces persists despite legislation prohibiting it. Victims face burdensome processes to seek redress, leading to low reporting rates. Recommendations include imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent harassment.","Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5.  
 
This means that an individual, who may (and often does) have limited access to the law, is 
obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the  AHRC , in order to seek redress. This 
process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without l egal advice. We will return to 
our concerns regarding the current system  in our discussion on the Complaints Process.   
 
It can also be daunting for victims who are emotionally distressed, unfamiliar with legal 
processes, fearful of reprisal, and who are un sure of their legal rights. Further, women who 
are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career 
mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. 
 
Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9.

 ------------7. Recommendations to address sexual harassment in Australian workplaces.  
 
Maurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations:  
 
1. That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace -related 
sexual and sex -based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against 
employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
2. That AHRC should  consider ways that  employers can assist in creating a workplace 
where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not 
impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment.  
 
3. That AHRC  investigate  how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on -line 
sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented.  
 
4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on -line sexual 
harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools 
to allow them to:  
 Seek inj unctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on -line sexual 
harassment, and  
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online 
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to 
monitor and prote ct users.  
 
5. That the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable 
steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident 
has occurred or not.  
 
6. That State and Territory WHS authorities be explicitly authorised to investigate and 
impose sanctions on employers who have breached their duty to provide safe and 
without risk workplaces, particularly in the context of sexual harassment.  
 
7. That State and Territory WHS authorities be appropriately resourced to investigate 
and prosecute risks to health and safety arising from sexual harassment.  
 
8. That trade unions be granted the authority to prosecute for health and safety 
breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed.

Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the

harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation

What legislative suggestions pertaining to workplace sexual harassment does the firm provide in its submission?,"The firm suggests that employers should have a positive obligation to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.

We note that this was recommended by the HREOC  in their submission to the Senate Inqui ry 
on the Effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act, in 200812 but was not adopted. We are of 
the view that it should have been.  
 
ii. Health and Safety  
 
The duty proposed in the previous section should not detract from the current and often 
ignored responsibilit y of safety regulators in each S tate and Territory  to investigate and 
prosecute breaches of health and safety legislation.  
 
In our view, it should be made abundantly clear, via legislative reform or through delegated 
legislation, that regulat ors are required to investigate sexual harassment complaints given 
the health and safety implications of same.  
 
We acknowledge that regulators are chronically understaffed and underfunded in many 
States and Territories and would encourage the establishmen t of a properly funded discrete 
directorate within WHS regulators aimed at investigating risks to health and safety arising 
from sexual harassment.  
 
In order to reduce the load on regulators, trade unions should also have the ability to 
prosecute for heal th and safety breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed.  
 
iii. Expanding company reporting requirements  
 
It has been argued b y the leading academics in this space that the prevention of sexual 
harassment is enhanced if senior managers in a w orkplace understand what behaviour 
constitutes sexual harassment and that there are consequences for the business if it 
occurs13.  
 
Maurice Blackburn considers the elimination of sexual harassment against women in the 
workplace to be an essential component of achieving gender equality more broadly.

workplace sexual harassment, this may have broader carriage withi n AHRC .   
 
Further, it is our view that claimants should be able to elect to bypass the AHRC and proceed 
straight to Court. The decision to take such a bold step would necessarily be influenced by 
the anticipated attitude of an employer and the length of t ime likely taken to get a mediation 
at the AHRC.

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,The scarcity of data on mediations can impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process by hindering the ability to identify key factors influencing outcomes. This lack of information may lead to delays in addressing complaints and cause complainants to feel fatigued and worn down by the process. Implementing time frames for scheduling mediation conferences could help address these concerns and provide more certainty for complainants.,"Model of Mediation  
 
The study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald23 found that a number of 
factors influenced the outcome including differences in the manner in which mediators  
conducted the mediation , whether the complainant had found another job and of course 
the level of harm and distress they had suffered.  
 
It is our  observation that the approach taken to mediation in the AHRC is for a mediator 
to take a light touch and express no view as to the merits of a claim or, conversely, as to 
the potential liability and risk of a respondent to a claim. In our view, a more rob ust 
approach to mediation  should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at 
mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in 
dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment matters, Maurice Blackburn is of t he 
view that a higher level of certainty with respect to how the mediation  conferences are 
conducted  should be given to complainants.

Currently, participation in the mediation  process with the AHRC is voluntary for

actions of their employers  - who either do not file a response or do not attend mediation

obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the  AHRC , in order to seek redress. This 
process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without l egal advice. We will return to 
our concerns regarding the current system  in our discussion on the Complaints Process.   
 
It can also be daunting for victims who are emotionally distressed, unfamiliar with legal 
processes, fearful of reprisal, and who are un sure of their legal rights. Further, women who 
are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career 
mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. 
 
Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9.  
 
That means that in 83 percent of cases, the victims did not make a complaint for a whole 
host of reasons. These statistics demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases the current 
legislative scheme  has both failed to prevent the conduct through deterrence, and has failed 
to address the conduct through providing victims with access to an adequate remedy.

Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of

In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where individuals cause, enable, or expose others to such behavior. This includes holding employers, social media platforms, and those distributing abusive material accountable. A legislative framework should incorporate regulation, criminal sanctions, and a civil regime to provide victims with legal tools for relief and damages."," The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material.  
 
We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.  
 
Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.  
 
 That t he statutory body can order that offending materials be removed  from an on -line 
platform , and require a  correction and/or an apology.
