In the mid to later part of the 20th century, ﬁnance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the eﬃcient
markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the
ﬁeld on a new, solid scientiﬁc foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were
powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders,
leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset
pricing, eﬃcient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing
to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for

 ------------(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein
(2001). As appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted
dynamical process describing how market eﬃciency comes about. The second foundation for eﬃcient market
theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization

 ------------First, the area has many open questions that more standard modeling approaches have not been able to
resolve. Second there is a large amount of ﬁnancial data available for testing. It will be interesting to see if,
sometime in the future, ﬁnancial economists eventually replace the stylized theories of equilibrium market
dynamics with a more realistic picture of the continuing struggle of learning and adapting agents who push
markets in the direction of eﬃciency, even though they never quite reach this goal.

Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because the key debates in finance about market efficiency and rationality are still unresolved.

Agent-based models view financial markets as groups of learning agents with bounded rationality.","Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons.

time series contain many curious puzzles that are not well understood. Third, ﬁnancial markets provide a
wealth of pricing and volume data that can be analyzed. Fourth, when considering evolution, ﬁnancial
markets provide a good approximation to a crude ﬁtness measure through wealth or return performance.
Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets.
Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market

side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any

questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.
Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of","['Correct', 'Correct', 'Correct']","['The answer provides a comprehensive list of different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market.

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,Lettau's framework involves a financial market model with heterogeneous learning agents making portfolio choices. The model includes a risky asset with a random dividend and a risk-free asset. Agents' preferences exhibit constant absolute risk aversion and are parameterized accordingly. The framework uses a genetic algorithm to optimize agent parameters over multiple periods.,"Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement.
The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in
a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model
with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously
given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth
of agents is given by,
w=s(d−p), (2)
and their preferences are assumed to exhibit constant absolute risk aversion which can be parameterized as
in,
U(w) =−e−γw. (3)
This is clearly a very simpliﬁed market. No attempt is made to look at the feedback from agents’ demands

 ------------but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)

 ------------crossed with another rule chosen at random according to a ﬁxed crossover probability. Crossover chooses a
midpoint in each of the two bitstrings, and then combines the ﬁrst substring of one rule, with the second
substring of another rule. This new set of rules is then mutated, where each bit is ﬂipped according to a
ﬁxed probability. In Lettau’s framework the mutation rate is slowly decayed over time, so that eventually
mutation probabilities go to zero. This is a form of cooling down the learning rates as time progresses. After
mutation, the new population is ready to go back to purchasing the risky asset for another Speriods before
the GA is run again.
Lettau’s results show that in various speciﬁcations the GA can learn the optimal parameter for the

more parameters.

The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t/p2,t. In an equilibrium, the returns of both currencies must be equal.

The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.

 ------------continues to progress to higher ﬁtness levels.
Arifovic analyzes the dynamics of this market for various parameter values. The results show that the
ﬁrst-period consumption level converges to a stable value close to the optimum. However, the exchange rate
continues to move over time, never settling to any constant value. There is an interesting interpretation
for this dynamic price process. In the equilibrium the return on the two assets is the same, so the learning
agents are indiﬀerent between holding the two currencies. Groups of agents move to holding one currency or
another, the exchange rate moves around as they shift demands between currencies. In a model such as this,
it is clear that a constant exchange rate equilibrium can only be maintained through some mechanism that
shuts down learning and exploration in the model. Arifovic also shows that similar features are obtained in
experimental markets.30

The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in","['Incorrect', 'Incorrect', 'Incorrect']","['The answer provided does not directly address the question asked.

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters, with unclear impacts. The use of various computational tools and methods in these models has also been questioned. The diversity in design structures makes comparisons across platforms difficult.","5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.
Table 1 gives a short overview of the design structures of some of the agent-based ﬁnancial market models
described in this paper. This is far from being an all inclusive list, since many of the models described in this
chapter would not ﬁt well into the criteria for the list. This emphasizes what should have become clear from
the earlier sections: agent-based ﬁnancial models have been built using many diﬀerent features and designs.
This is natural for a ﬁeld at this early stage, but it has made comparisons across market platforms diﬃcult.

 ------------A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism
leveled at agent-based ﬁnancial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are
able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms
at their discretion in the attempt to ﬁt sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based ﬁnancial markets
must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all
experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the ﬁeld is moving that will give these markets
a more solid foundation.
Some steps that researchers can take to ameliorate these problems include replicating diﬃcult empirical
features, putting parameters under evolutionary control, and using results from experimental markets. The
ﬁrst of these suggestions involves making sure that an agent-based ﬁnancial market ﬁts facts which are not

 ------------agents are then allowed to continue playing the game after the price series is shut oﬀ, and the continued
model dynamics are used in a kind of out of sample forecasting context. They are able to produce some
small forecasting gains in some high frequency data. It remains to be seen how robust and reliable these
numbers are, but this is an interesting test of the minority game model on real data.54

How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an ignored final problem in the complaint process, with delays of 3 to 12 months common before mediation is scheduled.

The effect of this change is significant. While this time limit does not operate in the same way 
as a statutory limitation period does, the effect of a decision of the President to terminate the 
complaint is that a complainant loses access to the confident ial mediation process facilitated 
by the AHRC.  
 
The benefit of having access to the AHRC’s mediation process is that it allows victims of 
sexual harassment, whom typically have restricted access to the law, the opportunity to 
engage in a relatively low co st, less adversarial dispute resolution process.  
 
Maurice Blackburn submits the Amendment should be repealed and that the time for making 
complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law  jurisdictions.

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces is a persistent issue despite legislation prohibiting it since 1984. The current legislative scheme places the burden on victims to seek redress rather than imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent harassment. Recommendations include enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace and investigating criminal and civil regimes to combat online sexual harassment.,"Page 7 
  
i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5.

 7. Recommendations to address sexual harassment in Australian workplaces.  
 
Maurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations:  
 
1. That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace -related 
sexual and sex -based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against 
employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
2. That AHRC should  consider ways that  employers can assist in creating a workplace 
where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not 
impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment.  
 
3. That AHRC  investigate  how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on -line 
sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented.  
 
4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on -line sexual 
harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools 
to allow them to:

What legislative suggestions pertaining to workplace sexual harassment does the firm provide in its submission?,"The firm suggests imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent sexual harassment, authorizing WHS authorities to investigate and sanction breaches, and requiring reporting of incidents to the board and an external organization. They also recommend granting trade unions the authority to prosecute for health and safety breaches. Additionally, they propose that businesses report incidents of sexual harassment as part of gender equality reporting to drive cultural change.","Submission in Response

Businesses are already required by legislation to report on key gender equality indicators to 
WGEA annually. We are of the view that as part of this reporting, businesses should also be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment.  
 
Further, r eporting to Board and senior management level (in smaller business) must also be  
mandated if real cultural change is to occur.  
 
Whilst we acknowledge that the figure reported will not be representative of the true number 
of instances of sexual harassment given the very low reporting rates, we are of the view that 
this measure would c reate an important incentive for large businesses, and their senior 
managers, to take their obligation to prevent sexual harassment seriously.

In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where individuals engage in particularly nefarious behaviors, and when employers, social media platforms, and those who generate abusive material are involved. It is important to provide police and regulatory services with the resources to successfully prosecute offenders. Additionally, a civil process should be in place to allow victims to seek relief and damages from perpetrators and facilitators of online harassment.","This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material.  
 
We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.

 ------------line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people

 ------------We submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it  is 
important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:  
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual
