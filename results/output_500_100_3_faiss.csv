markets in the direction of eﬃciency, even though they never quite reach this goal.

Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because the key debates in finance about market efficiency and rationality are still unresolved. Additionally, financial time series contain many puzzles that are not well understood, leading to the need for models that consider agents with varying abilities to process information and attitudes towards risk. Agent-based computational finance models stress the importance of simple adaptive behaviors in understanding the dynamics of financial markets.","Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons.

What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the design of the economic environment and addressing various basic design questions.

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters, with the impact of many parameters not well understood. Another criticism is the concern about validation due to researchers having too many degrees of freedom to fit stylized facts. Additionally, there is a lack of guidance on basic design questions when constructing agent-based financial markets.","5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.

 ------------A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism
leveled at agent-based ﬁnancial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are
able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms

How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is often an ignored final problem in agent-based models, requiring explicit assumptions about decisions, information, and trade. Asset pricing models also need to make choices about timing, especially in computer simulations where events need to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions can have a significant impact on outcomes.","inductive spirit of simple rules of thumb.
A ﬁnal problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump-
tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to
make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,The persistent prevalence of sexual harassment in Australian workplaces suggests that current legislation has failed to prevent this conduct.
