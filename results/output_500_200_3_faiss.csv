In agent-based financial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is crucial, represented by a distribution of agents or wealth across different strategies.

In the mid to later part of the 20th century, ﬁnance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the eﬃcient
markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the

sometime in the future, ﬁnancial economists eventually replace the stylized theories of equilibrium market
dynamics with a more realistic picture of the continuing struggle of learning and adapting agents who push
markets in the direction of eﬃciency, even though they never quite reach this goal.

What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the design of the economic environment and deciding on the types of markets to create.

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework includes the optimal linear functional form for agent i, si=αi(¯d−p).

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters, with the impact of many parameters not well understood. Critics also point out that researchers have too much freedom to change internal mechanisms to fit stylized facts. Validation and the large number of degrees of freedom are common concerns in agent-based financial markets.","5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.

 ------------A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism
leveled at agent-based ﬁnancial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are
able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms

How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is often an ignored final problem in agent-based models and asset pricing models. Explicit assumptions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade are necessary. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is important to consider.","inductive spirit of simple rules of thumb.
A ﬁnal problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump-
tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to
make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In
the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,"Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces has been prohibited since the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984, but its persistent prevalence suggests that the current legislation has not been effective in preventing such conduct.
