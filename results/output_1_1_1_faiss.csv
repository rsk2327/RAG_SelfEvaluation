The author is grateful to many people who have made comments on earlier drafts. These include W.",Correct,The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of what is meant by 'computational finance'. It accurately describes the use of computational tools to create models in financial settings and highlights the importance of understanding investor behavior and financial market complexities.
What is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'?,"Investor heterogeneity refers to the differences in characteristics, preferences, and expectations among investors in the market. In the context mentioned, it involves exploring how well the predictions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model hold up when agents have varying attributes. The model in question only incorporates heterogeneity through mean expectations.","42In Levy et al. (2000) begin to explore some simple multi asset models. Their goal is to begin to understand how well the
predictions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model hold up in heterogeneous agent situations. Their early ﬁndings are supportive
of the CAPM, but the model only allows heterogeneity to enter in a limited way, through mean expectations. 43See Baillie et al. (1996) for an example of a fractionally integrated volatility process. Also, see LeBaron (2001 c) for further
discussion of fractional integration in stock return series. 27",Correct,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of what is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'. It effectively describes the differences in characteristics, preferences, and expectations among investors in the market and how it relates to the Capital Asset Pricing Model."
What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?,"The revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century was the shift towards more realistic models of market dynamics, focusing on the ongoing struggle of learning and adapting agents. This move aimed to capture the push towards market efficiency, even though it may never be fully achieved. The availability of a large amount of financial data played a significant role in this evolution.","Second there is a large amount of ﬁnancial data available for testing. It will be interesting to see if,
sometime in the future, ﬁnancial economists eventually replace the stylized theories of equilibrium market
dynamics with a more realistic picture of the continuing struggle of learning and adapting agents who push
markets in the direction of eﬃciency, even though they never quite reach this goal. 42",Correct,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century, highlighting the shift towards more realistic models of market dynamics and the role of financial data. Well done."
Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because rules of thumb are built on simple adaptive behaviors. The key debates in finance about market efficiency and rationality remain unresolved, leading to the need for agent-based methods. The concept of market efficiency is supported by theoretical and empirical backing, but there is no truly accepted dynamical process describing how it comes about.","or is presupposing that markets are not well represented by equilibrium rational stories. However, it is
stressing that rules of thumb need to be built from a foundation of simple adaptive behaviors. Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons. First, the key debates in ﬁnance about market eﬃciency and rationality are still unresolved. Second, ﬁnancial
time series contain many curious puzzles that are not well understood. Third, ﬁnancial markets provide a
wealth of pricing and volume data that can be analyzed. Fourth, when considering evolution, ﬁnancial
markets provide a good approximation to a crude ﬁtness measure through wealth or return performance. Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets. Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market
eﬃciency has a strong theoretical and empirical backing which should not be ignored.5On the theoretical
side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any
predictable components either in their own past series, or connected to fundamentals, the remaining rational
investors will reduce these to zero. This is very close to the evolutionary arguments put forth in both Alchian
(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein
(2001). As appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted
dynamical process describing how market eﬃciency comes about. The second foundation for eﬃcient market
theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization
were brought to bear on these problems.8This led to an even stronger representation for ﬁnancial markets,
the representative agent.9This model formally connects asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate
individual who can then be linked to various state variables of the macroeconomy. 5The ﬁeld has been surveyed many places, but the classic surveys remain Fama (1970) and Fama (1991). 6Examples are in Cootner (1964) and Fama (1970). 7It is also important to note that the radical idea that randomness was a good model for ﬁnancial prices goes back to the
beginning of the 20th century in Bachelier (1900). 8See, for example, Merton (1971), Breedon (1979), and Lucas (1978).",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents. It discusses the use of rules of thumb, the unresolved debates in finance, the need for agent-based methods, and the lack of a truly accepted dynamical process for market efficiency."
Why are the financial markets appealing applications for agent-based methods?,"Financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods due to their complexity and nonlinearity, making them difficult to estimate using traditional tools. Agent-based modelers must consider these challenges when evaluating market simulations. These markets present an important challenge and opportunity for showcasing the value of agent-based methods.","Unfortunately, this may also make them diﬃcult to estimate
using traditional econometric tools. Agent-based modelers should be aware of these nonlinear issues, and
take them into account when evaluating market simulations. Financial markets are an important challenge for agent-based computational modelers. Financial markets
may be one of the important early areas where agent-based methods show their worth, for two basic reasons. 41",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods, highlighting their complexity and nonlinearity. It also mentions the challenges faced by agent-based modelers and the opportunity to showcase the value of these methods."
What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the computational tools to use, addressing important design issues, and deciding on the structure of the market model. Unfortunately, there is often a lack of guidance on which direction to take when answering these questions.","The remainder of this chapter will summarize recent work on agent-based computational models in
ﬁnance. The next section introduces some of the computational tools and design issues that are important
in building markets. Section 3 covers artiﬁcial market models that attempt to recreate an entire market. Section 4 covers a few other types of markets which do not ﬁt into the earlier categories. Section 5 covers
some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future. 2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.",Correct,The answer provides a comprehensive list of different design questions involved in constructing an agent-based financial market. It also acknowledges the lack of guidance in answering these questions.
Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves using the optimal linear functional form for agent i, represented by the formula si=αi(¯d−p). Agents need to learn the optimal α to solve the portfolio problem. The market operates for S periods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period.",Correct,"The student has provided a clear explanation of Lettau's framework, including the optimal linear functional form for agent i and the concept of learning the optimal alpha to solve the portfolio problem. The mention of the market operating for S periods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period adds depth to the explanation."
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by the formula et=p1,t/p2,t. Agents care about the relative returns of the two currencies, which must be equal in equilibrium. The demand for savings is determined by the agents' maximization problem.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal. Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value. The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency.",Incorrect,The answer provided does not directly address the question asked. It discusses agents' maximization problem and demand for savings instead of providing the formula for the exchange rate.
Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based market models face criticisms regarding the lack of general principles for construction and the stability of results with new trading strategies. The complexity of nonlinear strategies could potentially exploit arbitrage opportunities, challenging the effectiveness of agent-based models. Additionally, the criticism of assuming a small number of assets in these models limits their ability to capture the complexities of real financial markets.","Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves. (Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment. This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism. Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well
to models with a single representative risky asset. Questions naturally arise about calibrating to aggregate
dividends, and exactly what this calibration means, since aggregate dividends are not paid by any single
stock. Also, recent events such as the technology bubble of the 1990s remind us that bubbles are often very
sector dependent.",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive discussion of the criticisms faced by agent-based market models, including the lack of general principles for construction, stability issues with new trading strategies, potential exploitation of arbitrage opportunities due to complexity of nonlinear strategies, and limitations in capturing the complexities of real financial markets."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an ignored final problem because it can significantly impact results, especially in strategies like delayed price adjustment. The timing of when prices are adjusted based on market demand can have a large impact on outcomes. In a world of evolving strategies, the importance of timing should not be overlooked.","The degree to which results depend on
arbitrary timing decisions is deﬁnitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed
price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It
is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the
39",Incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address the question asked. It focuses more on the impact of timing in strategies like delayed price adjustment, rather than explaining why timing is considered an ignored final problem."

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces is a persistent issue despite legislation prohibiting it since 1984. The current legislative scheme places the burden on victims to seek redress rather than imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent harassment. This can be particularly challenging for vulnerable groups and contributes to low reporting rates.,"Maurice Blackburn Lawyers submission to the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces . Page 7 
  
i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5. This means that an individual, who may (and often does) have limited access to the law, is 
obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the  AHRC , in order to seek redress. This 
process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without l egal advice. We will return to 
our concerns regarding the current system  in our discussion on the Complaints Process. It can also be daunting for victims who are emotionally distressed, unfamiliar with legal 
processes, fearful of reprisal, and who are un sure of their legal rights. Further, women who 
are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career 
mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9. That means that in 83 percent of cases, the victims did not make a complaint for a whole 
host of reasons. These statistics demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases the current 
legislative scheme  has both failed to prevent the conduct through deterrence, and has failed 
to address the conduct through providing victims with access to an adequate remedy. Under the current scheme, an employer’s obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent 
sexual h arassment only becomes relevant where they are defending a claim of sexual 
harassment  - that is, after the harassment and the harm have already occurred10. Specifically, under s106 of the SDA an employer can escape vicarious liability for sexual 
harassmen t, where it can establish that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the sexual 
harassment from occurring11. 5 Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, P arliament of Australia, Half Way to Equal: Report of the 
Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia  (1992) (‘Halfway to Equal Report’).",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how sexual harassment is a persistent issue in Australian workplaces despite legislation prohibiting it since 1984. It also highlights the burden on victims to seek redress rather than employers having a positive obligation to prevent harassment, which can be challenging for vulnerable groups and leads to low reporting rates."
What legislative suggestions pertaining to workplace sexual harassment does the firm provide in its submission?,"The firm suggests implementing a positive duty on employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace. They also recommend introducing a statutory definition of sexual harassment to provide clarity and consistency in understanding and addressing the issue. Additionally, the firm proposes establishing a new independent statutory body to oversee compliance with the positive duty and provide guidance and support to employers and employees.","

It covers the implementation of a positive duty on employers, introducing a statutory definition of sexual harassment, and establishing a new independent statutory body for oversight and support."
How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by limiting the understanding of outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. This lack of data hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of the mediation process in achieving just results for complainants. Proper funding and staffing of the AHRC are crucial to address this issue and fulfill statutory objectives.,"The Complaints Process  
 
In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants. Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives. Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process  
 
These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to 
                                                
19 Therese  MacDermott  (2015) ‘Reassessing Sexual Harassment: It's time’ Alternative Law Journal , 40(3), 157. 20 Harassment compensation caps outdated in #MeToo era  ",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It highlights the limitations in understanding outcomes and assessing effectiveness, and suggests a solution to address the issue."
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, as designated by the firm, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm in the first place. The firm believes there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace. They also suggest amending the timeframe for making complaints through AHRC to be in line with other jurisdictions.","This includes observations on the variou s pieces of legislation which 
make up the current framework, the complaints and appeals processes, and the assistance 
available to victims. The impacts on victims can be life long and life changing. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the signif icant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail 
in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. We believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully 
aware of the incidence of sexual haras sment in their workplace, and that they should be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their 
reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’). We believe that the current legislated tim eframe for making a complaint through AHRC is 
unworkable and out of step with other legislative provisions. It should be amended to 6 years 
in line with other employment law jurisdictions. We believe that the Australian Human Rights 
Commission Act 1986 (th e AHRC Act) or regulations should be amended to expressly 
prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences. We believe that other authorities, such as State and Territory Work, Health and Safety 
regulators, along with trade unions and con sumer advocates, could and should have a 
greater role to play in addressing and stamping out workplace sexual harassment. Above all, we believe that the AHRC should be properly funded and fully staffed in order to 
fulfil its statutory objectives and enab le it to more swiftly and robustly perform its vital role in 
resolving claims of sexual harassment in the workplace. In preparing this submission, Maurice Blackburn has engaged with a number of 
organisations such as NOW Australia and Unions NSW, who share  our goal of preventing 
sexual harassment from occurring in Australian workplaces and securing justice for victims. Specifically, Maurice Blackburn, NOW Australia and Unions NSW hosted a roundtable with ",Correct,The student accurately identifies one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme as placing the onus on victims to seek redress instead of obligating employers to prevent harm. The student also correctly mentions the firm's belief in enforceable sanctions against employers for failing to provide a safe workplace and suggests amending the timeframe for making complaints through AHRC.
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized when the abuser intends to cause harm through digital communication, when the victim would reasonably expect harm, and when particularly nefarious behaviors are involved. It is important to hold all parties accountable, including employers and social media platforms, to deter such behavior effectively. A legislative framework that combines regulation, criminal sanctions, and civil remedies is necessary to address the scope and pervasiveness of online sexual harassment."," Immediacy. Responding to on -line media does not encourage introspection or the 
tempering of language  or behaviour .  The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration. We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages. This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms. We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material. We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress. Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.  That t he statutory body can order that offending materials be removed  from an on -line 
platform , and require a  correction and/or an apology.  That the frameworks allows  for the release of the identity of  anonymous abusers.  That on -line sexual harassment is criminalise d where : 
o the abuser intends a digital communication to cause harm,  
o a person  would reasonably expect the person in the position of the victim to 
be harmed, and  ",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of when online sexual harassment should be criminalized, including the intention to cause harm, victim's reasonable expectation of harm, and involvement of particularly nefarious behaviors. It also emphasizes the importance of holding all parties accountable and the need for a legislative framework combining regulation, criminal sanctions, and civil remedies."
