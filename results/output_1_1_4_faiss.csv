 ------------1 Introduction
In the mid to later part of the 20th century, ﬁnance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the eﬃcient
markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the
ﬁeld on a new, solid scientiﬁc foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were
powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders,
leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset
pricing, eﬃcient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing
to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for
this new ﬁnancial rigor.2In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center
of a change in thinking about ﬁnancial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which
agents may diﬀer in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information,
their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions. Models in the realm of agent-based computational ﬁnance view ﬁnancial markets as interacting groups
of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand
the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would
be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3It is important to distinguish agent-based models
from other more general heterogeneous agent models in ﬁnance, since the latter have been part of the ﬁeld
for some time.4In agent-based ﬁnancial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is
represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a ﬁxed or changing set of strategies. In
principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in
general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form
of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded
rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual
agents. It is also important to remember that the simpliﬁed rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest
that the exercise is forcing some sort of simpliﬁed solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,
1This view is not far oﬀ the more general perspective on information dissemination in the economy as a whole put forth in
Hayek (1945). 2A good early collection of work from this era is Cootner (1964).

 ------------3.2 Model dynamics under learning
The papers described in this section are more computational than those mentioned previously. In most
cases the small sets of tractable trading rules are replaced with larger sets of strategies, which are usually
represented using various computational techniques. These will be referred to as many-type models. This
ﬁrst section concentrates on applications where the economic environment is well understood and where there
is often a simple homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium which gives a useful benchmark comparison. Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in
a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model
with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously
given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth
of agents is given by,
w=s(d−p), (2)
and their preferences are assumed to exhibit constant absolute risk aversion which can be parameterized as
in,
U(w) =−e−γw. (3)
This is clearly a very simpliﬁed market.

 ------------The remainder of this chapter will summarize recent work on agent-based computational models in
ﬁnance. The next section introduces some of the computational tools and design issues that are important
in building markets. Section 3 covers artiﬁcial market models that attempt to recreate an entire market. Section 4 covers a few other types of markets which do not ﬁt into the earlier categories. Section 5 covers
some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future. 2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered.

What is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'?,"Investor heterogeneity refers to the differences among investors in terms of their expectations, preferences, and behaviors in the financial markets.

Their goal is to begin to understand how well the
predictions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model hold up in heterogeneous agent situations. Their early ﬁndings are supportive
of the CAPM, but the model only allows heterogeneity to enter in a limited way, through mean expectations. 43See Baillie et al. (1996) for an example of a fractionally integrated volatility process. Also, see LeBaron (2001 c) for further
discussion of fractional integration in stock return series. 27

Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because rules of thumb are built on simple adaptive behaviors. The unresolved debates on market efficiency and rationality in finance contribute to this view. Additionally, financial markets provide a wealth of data for analysis and are connected to relevant experimental results.","or is presupposing that markets are not well represented by equilibrium rational stories. However, it is
stressing that rules of thumb need to be built from a foundation of simple adaptive behaviors. Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons. First, the key debates in ﬁnance about market eﬃciency and rationality are still unresolved. Second, ﬁnancial
time series contain many curious puzzles that are not well understood. Third, ﬁnancial markets provide a
wealth of pricing and volume data that can be analyzed. Fourth, when considering evolution, ﬁnancial
markets provide a good approximation to a crude ﬁtness measure through wealth or return performance. Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets. Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market
eﬃciency has a strong theoretical and empirical backing which should not be ignored.5On the theoretical
side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any
predictable components either in their own past series, or connected to fundamentals, the remaining rational
investors will reduce these to zero. This is very close to the evolutionary arguments put forth in both Alchian
(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein
(2001). As appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted
dynamical process describing how market eﬃciency comes about. The second foundation for eﬃcient market
theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization
were brought to bear on these problems.8This led to an even stronger representation for ﬁnancial markets,
the representative agent.9This model formally connects asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate
individual who can then be linked to various state variables of the macroeconomy. 5The ﬁeld has been surveyed many places, but the classic surveys remain Fama (1970) and Fama (1991). 6Examples are in Cootner (1964) and Fama (1970). 7It is also important to note that the radical idea that randomness was a good model for ﬁnancial prices goes back to the
beginning of the 20th century in Bachelier (1900). 8See, for example, Merton (1971), Breedon (1979), and Lucas (1978).

 ------------Unfortunately, this may also make them diﬃcult to estimate
using traditional econometric tools. Agent-based modelers should be aware of these nonlinear issues, and
take them into account when evaluating market simulations. Financial markets are an important challenge for agent-based computational modelers. Financial markets
may be one of the important early areas where agent-based methods show their worth, for two basic reasons. 41

 ------------These results appears to be connected to the presence of short-memory traders. Eliminating the latter group
leads the market to converge to a well-deﬁned rational expectations equilibrium. Other modiﬁcations are
shown to improve learning and to induce the market to converge. Among these are slowing down the rate at
which agents switch rules, and having them switch strategies only when a new strategy beats the current one
by a certain threshold [LeBaron (2002 b)]. Both of these operate to slow down the learning process, which
one would think would make things worse. The strategies used in this market are emergent in that they are not prewired into the model. It is
interesting to note that the learning process does evolve as the market progresses. LeBaron (2001 a) shows
that in the early stages of the market, predictability is quite high. Regressions of returns on simple lagged
returns can yield R-squared values as high as 0 .7. These patterns are quickly learned by agents, however,
and this unrealistically high predictability is greatly reduced. It is also interesting that the dividend-price
ratio remains a consistently good predictor in many diﬀerent time periods, which is consistent with results
from real ﬁnancial data. Bullard & Duﬀy (2001) introduce learning into a more traditional macroeconomic framework for asset
prices. The model is a multiperiod overlapping generations setup with a constant returns to scale aggregate
production technology. Also, important is the fact that the government issues money in the economy at
a constant growth rate that is greater than the growth rate of the economy. Therefore, the forecasting of
inﬂation and real returns becomes an important problem for agents in this economy. They forecast future
price levels using a recursive regression framework. This learning mechanism yields excess volatility in the
asset market. The authors perform a search over their parameter space using a genetic algorithm to ﬁnd
parameters generating results similar to actual data. They ﬁnd parameter values that are able to give them
reasonable volatility in asset returns along with a low volatility in per capita consumption growth. For the
most part, the parameter values that generate these results are consistent with U.S. macroeconomic data. 3.4.4 Other calibration examples
This section brieﬂy summarizes several other calibration examples which try to line up with interesting
data sets, and scrutinize time series generated by agent-based ﬁnancial markets. Arifovic & Masson (1999)
implement an agent-based model of foreign exchange currency crises which is aligned with empirical results
from foreign exchange crises periods. Another model examining foreign exchange markets is Marey (2004)
which uses foreign exchange survey forecasts to calibrate agent behavior. Finally, several papers such as Chen,
with results in Gallant et al.

 ------------entirely independent of volatility persistence. The unconditional distributions of most volatility persistent
processes are fat tailed, even when their conditional distributions are Gaussian. Beyond the frequency of
large moves there is a continuing debate about the exact shape of the tails of return distributions. It is
possible that these may be described by power laws.19
One of the reasons for this wide range of puzzles is another justiﬁcation for ﬁnance being a good agent-
based test bed. Financial data are generally plentiful, accurate, and available on many diﬀerent aspects of
ﬁnancial market functions. Good time series of up to forty years are available on prices and volume. Series
of lengths up to one hundred years are available for lower frequencies, and for certain securities. Over the
past twenty years, extremely high frequency data has become available. These series often record every trade
or every order entering a ﬁnancial market, and sometimes include some information as to the identity of
traders. Therefore, researchers have a detailed picture of exactly how the market is unfolding, and the exact
dynamics of trade clearing. Also, series are available that show detailed holdings of institutions, such as
mutual funds, and that record the ﬂows coming in and out of these funds. For individuals a few series have
been used that reveal the trades of investors’ accounts at various brokerage ﬁrms.20This gives an amazing
level of detail about the behavior of individuals which will be useful in the construction and validation of
agent-based models. Finally, experimental data are available that can be used to line up and calibrate agent
behavior. Several of the models covered here have already done this, and more examples of using experiments
are given in Duﬀy (2005). Finance experiments are particularly appealing since they often can be done at
time scales that are reasonable for the real data. It is more credible that you can simulate a day of trading
in the laboratory, than to simulate someone’s entire life cycle. To summarize, ﬁnancial markets are particularly well suited for agent-based explorations. They are
large well-organized markets for trading securities which can be easily compared. Currently, the established
theoretical structure of market eﬃciency and rational expectations is being questioned. There is a long list of
empirical features that traditional approaches have not been able to match. Agent-based approaches provide
an intriguing possibility for solving some of these puzzles.21Finally, ﬁnancial markets are rich in data sets
that can be used for testing and calibrating agent-based models. High quality data are available at many
frequencies, and in many diﬀerent forms.

questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods. Table 1 gives a short overview of the design structures of some of the agent-based ﬁnancial market models

What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the basic design structures, selecting computational tools and methods, and considering market microstructure questions. Researchers often face a lack of guidance in deciding which direction to follow when answering these design questions.

 ------------4 Other markets
This sections covers several ﬁnancial market models which are diﬀerent from those considered above. Among
these are markets which consider detailed trading institutions and learning market makers, and also models
which consider the coevolution of strategies and ﬁnancial securities. Most of the markets considered up to now have abstracted away from actual trading institutions. This
is somewhat of a puzzle in the agent-based ﬁnance world, since a bottom up approach would appear to call
for starting from the basics of how trades are executed. Most models build stylized economic structures that
avoid the institutional details of trading. However, research has begun appearing which implements more
realistic trading systems.48Market design and market microstructure questions appear to be well suited for

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves using the optimal linear functional form for agent i, si=αi(¯d−p). Agents need to learn the optimal α for the portfolio problem. The main exercise in Lettau's paper is to see if and when agents can learn the optimal portfolio strategy using a genetic algorithm.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period.

 ------------No attempt is made to look at the feedback from agents’ demands
to returns on the risky asset. There is no consumption, and wealth is not linked to agents’ impact on asset
prices, or evolution. However, it is a very straightforward test of learning in a ﬁnancial market. Given the normally distributed dividend process, there is a well-known optimal solution to the portfolio
problem given by,
s∗=α∗(¯d−p) (4)
α∗=1
γσ2
d(5)
where σ2
dis the variance of the random dividend payout. The main exercise in Lettau’s paper is to see if and
when agents are able to learn this optimal portfolio strategy using a genetic algorithm. In general, agents’
policy functions could take the form of
s=s(¯d, p), (6)
13

 ------------The evolution of strategies is similar to Lettau (1997). The ﬁtness of a strategy is determined by its
ex post utility, and a new population is drawn using ﬁtness proportional selection. Agents are paired, and
a crossover operator is applied to each pair with a given probability generating two new children. When
crossover is not used, the children are direct copies of the parents. These children are then mutated by
ﬂipping bits with a certain probability. The ﬁtness of the new rules is then estimated by implementing them
on the previous round of prices and returns. At this point all four of the children and parents are grouped

It briefly mentions the optimal linear functional form but lacks in-depth explanation and mathematical details. Additionally, the reference to a genetic algorithm is not directly related to Lettau's framework."
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t p2,t. Agents' maximization problem yields demand for savings st=m1,t p1,t+m2,t p2,t=1 2(w1−w21 Rt). The model has a fundamental indeterminacy leading to infinitely many equilibria. Arifovic and Sargent explored whether learning mechanisms converge to a single exchange rate.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal. Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value. The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency.

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Criticisms of agent-based markets include the lack of general principles for constructing models and the stability of results with new trading strategies. Another criticism is the assumption of a small number of assets in models, limiting their complexity and realism. The challenges of estimating and modeling financial markets with agent-based methods are also highlighted.","Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves. (Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment. This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism. Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well
to models with a single representative risky asset. Questions naturally arise about calibrating to aggregate
dividends, and exactly what this calibration means, since aggregate dividends are not paid by any single
stock. Also, recent events such as the technology bubble of the 1990s remind us that bubbles are often very
sector dependent.

 ------------Unfortunately, this may also make them diﬃcult to estimate
using traditional econometric tools. Agent-based modelers should be aware of these nonlinear issues, and
take them into account when evaluating market simulations. Financial markets are an important challenge for agent-based computational modelers. Financial markets
may be one of the important early areas where agent-based methods show their worth, for two basic reasons. 41

 ------------The remainder of this chapter will summarize recent work on agent-based computational models in
ﬁnance. The next section introduces some of the computational tools and design issues that are important
in building markets. Section 3 covers artiﬁcial market models that attempt to recreate an entire market. Section 4 covers a few other types of markets which do not ﬁt into the earlier categories. Section 5 covers
some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future. 2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.

 ------------data is not easy, and most agent-based models simply avoid this problem completely. Endogenously opening
multiple markets for trading is still a diﬃcult problem, but it needs to be addressed at some point. Once
researchers are more conﬁdent they have mastered agent-based modeling tools, they will probably tackle
multi-asset market modeling more frequently. Egenter, Lux & Stauﬀer (1999) address another interesting question for agent-based modelers to consider. What happens as the number of agents is increased? They have performed some tests on models that
can be studied analytically, and they ﬁnd that the dynamics can change dramatically as the number of
agents becomes large. What initially looks like random behavior for a small numbers of agents can become
increasingly predictable as the number of agents becomes very large. Is it possible that many of the nice
features that many models display are artifacts of the limitation to relatively small numbers of traders
imposed by computer modeling? This is a very important question.",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive discussion of the criticisms of agent-based markets, covering various aspects such as model construction, stability of results, asset limitations, complexity, realism, and challenges in estimating and modeling financial markets with agent-based methods."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an ignored final problem because victims of sexual harassment may face hurdles in bringing complaints within short time periods due to emotional and psychological impacts. The majority of complaints are made shortly after the events occurred, and the process of scheduling complaints for mediation can take months, leaving complainants fatigued. Maurice Blackburn suggests amending the AHRC Act to prescribe time frames for scheduling mediation conferences to address this issue.","Maurice Blackburn Lawyers submission to the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces . Page 10 
 There is no sound policy reason for the new time limit . At the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward 
by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate 
unmeritorious  or vexatious  claims being made14. The JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related 
to complaint handling  activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15. However, this 
recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a 
complaint16. Indeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the  
President’s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none 
of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for 
lodging a complaint. There is no evidence which suggest s claims that are mad e more than six months after 
the alleged events took place are less meritorious than those that are made before this 
time period. In fact, to the contrary, it is well documented that victims of sexual harassment may face 
a number of hurdles in bringing a  complaints in short time periods for a number of 
reasons, including the emotional and psychological impact the conduct often has them.17   
 
Of the 17 percent of people who made a complaint to their supervisor, the majority of 
complaints were made shortly a fter the events occurred. The statistics in relation to the 
timing of reporting sexual harassment were set out comprehensively by the AHRC in the 
Fourth Report, and are illustrated in the graph below.

 ------------The degree to which results depend on
arbitrary timing decisions is deﬁnitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed
price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It
is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the
39

 ------------First, the area has many open questions that more standard modeling approaches have not been able to
resolve.

 ------------This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour. In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time. While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in 
dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment matters, Maurice Blackburn is of t he 
view that a higher level of certainty with respect to how the mediation  conferences are 
conducted  should be given to complainants. Currently, participation in the mediation  process with the AHRC is voluntary for 
respondents. In our observation this le ads to claimants being further traumatised by the 
actions of their employers  - who either do not file a response or do not attend mediation  
or prevaricate regarding same . Maurice Blackburn is of the view that in order to encourage respondents and employe rs 
to participate in the mediation  process in meaningful, constructive and useful way, the 
AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the 
mediation  conference and to file a reply document in a specified period of time. Maurice Blackburn  further submits that the AHRC should consider the establishment of a 
victim advocate role within the AHRC  to represent individuals at mediation s where those 
individuals  cannot achieve  access to justice . We recognise that this service woul d need to be 
subject to some form of means test and/or other criteria  (by way of example - refugee status,

It mentions the emotional and psychological impacts on victims, the delays in scheduling complaints for mediation, and a suggested solution by Maurice Blackburn. Well done."

TCP Reports Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results
AURORA, Ohio , Aug. 7, 2014  /PRNewswire/ -- TCP International Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: TCPI), a leading global manufacturer 
and distributor of energy efficient lighting technologies, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 
30, 2014. Net sales for the second quarter were $112.5 million, an 11% increase compared with $101.1 million in the first quarter of 2014 
and a 1% increase compared with $111.2 million  in the second quarter of 2013. Net income in the second quarter was 
$2.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $3.9 million , or $0.19 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2014 and 
compared with $4.6 million , or $0.22 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2013. ""Our sales for the second quarter reflected our ongoing success to expand our LED product line in both our commercial and 
industrial and retail sales channels,"" said Ellis Yan, TCP's Chairman and CEO. ""Moving forward, we expect to leverage the 
investments we have made in our people and infrastructure to drive the continued growth of our LED product line.""
Second Quarter 2014 Summary
Following is a summary of certain key financial measures for the second quarter of 2014:
●Net sales were $112.5 million , an increase of $11.4 million , or 11%, from the first quarter of 2014 and an increase of $1.3 
million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2013. ●LED sales were $46.0 million , an increase of $9.7 million , or 27%, from the first quarter of 2014 and an increase of 
$18.2 million , or 65%, from the second quarter of 2013, driven by increased sales in the commercial and industrial, 
or C&I, channel and with Walmart. ●CFL sales were $59.5 million , roughly flat from the first quarter of 2014 and down $12.4 million , or 17%, from the 
second quarter of 2013, primarily due to the transition to LEDs in the C&I channel and lower volume with The 
Home Depot. ●Gross margin was 22.7%, down from 24.5% in the first quarter of 2014 and down from 24.3% in the second quarter of 
2013 due to the absence of favorable profit margins on a one -time order in 2013 and an increase in the provision for 
excess and obsolete inventory. ●Selling, general and administrative expenses were $20.4 million , an increase of $3.5 million  from the first quarter of 2014 
and an increase of $3.8 million  from the second quarter of 2013 due to higher payroll largely attributable to the 
expansion of our sales force and marketing team to serve the C&I channel, increased marketing costs, and share -based 
compensation expenses for new awards granted in connection with the IPO. ●Net income was $2.0 million , a decrease from $3.9 million  in the first quarter of 2014 and a decrease from $4.6 million  in 
the second quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $0.10, a decrease from diluted earnings per share of 
$0.19 in the first quarter of 2014 and a decrease from diluted earnings per share of $0.22 in the second quarter of 2013. ●Adjusted EBITDA was $7.7 million , compared to $10.0 million  in the first quarter of 2014 and $12.4 million  in the second 
quarter of 2013. At June 30, 2014 , cash and cash equivalents were $16.1 million , down from $23.0 million  at March 31, 2014 . On July 1, 2014 , 
TCP completed an initial public offering generating proceeds of $78.6 million , before deducting expenses of the offering 
estimated at $8.8 million . On a pro forma basis, after giving effect of the offering that will be recorded in the third quarter of 
2014, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were $85.9 million .

 ------------Combined short -term loans and long -term debt was 
$144.2 million  at June 30, 2014 , down from $146.8 million  at March 31 , 2014. We intend to use the net proceeds from our 
offering to acquire manufacturing equipment to expand our LED manufacturing capacity, for the repayment of indebtedness 
outstanding and for general corporate purposes. ",Correct,"The answer provided correctly states that the gross profit for the three months ended in 2013 was $27,007,000."

The Oregon Section helped arrange the 2007 District 6 (now Western District) m eeting that was held 
July 15 to 18 in Portland. This meeting was combined with the Quad Conference to expand  the reach 
of this event to our friends in Vancouver, BC. The Quad meeting was originally s cheduled to take 
place in 2008 in Portland, but the Oregon Section swapped meeting years with the  Vancouver Island 
Section in order to better coordinate the district and quad meetings (a w in-win situation for both 
Sections). The District 6 meeting was a huge success in that it attracted over 500 at tendees. The committee, 
chaired by Peter Koonce, was responsible for setting up a great techni cal and social event for the 
members of District 6. Some of the highlights include:

The Oregon Section maintained and enhanced the solid financial position that had been developed 
over the past several years. The Oregon Section has signed up for  online banking and uses a check 
card for most routine expenditures. Payments and account inquirie s are processed faster and the 
overall number of reimbursement checks are reduced significantly. Most monthly functions for the 2007-08 fiscal year have either broken even or in the case of the 
January Technical Workshop have had a net income due to better than a verage attendance. This can 
be attributed to interesting topics, user-friendly and informati ve web site as well as the hard work of 
Section officers and volunteers. The remainder of this page summar izes the Section’s 2007-2008

What are the standard rules of a golf game?,I don't know.,"9

 ------------12

 ------------If this is true the bit is set
to 1, and if it is false it is set to 0. 35Selection is by tournament selection. This means that, for every rule that is needed, two are picked at random and the
strongest is taken. 20

 ------------, 10. A second important innovation is the use of a common pool of rules, which the authors refer to as a
“business school.” This allows for some strategy learning to occur across agents in a very natural way.38
The rules in the common pool are evolved according to forecast accuracy. Traders then decide to update
their own strategies based on current performance. They draw rules from the common pool, comparing their
performance with their current rules. If the new rule is better they switch, but if they are unsuccessful after
several tries, they quit and stay with their current rule. Simulations of this ﬁnancial market display some features of actual return time series. They exhibit fat
tails, and visually they do not settle down to any price level. However, there are several features that disagree
with the actual data. For example, there is a large level of positive skew. Also, the linearly ﬁltered return
series are independent, which indicates there may be no persistent eﬀects in volatility. Another interesting
feature that the authors test for is a unit root in the price series. The standard tests cannot reject a unit
root. This is a little curious since the dividend process is stationary. It is probably sensible that in the long
run prices should not diverge too far from the fundamental, and should therefore also be stationary. Another ﬁnancial market model is the Genoa artiﬁcial market, Raberto, Cincotti, Focardi & Marchesi
(2001). In the original version of their market model the authors used random-order selection, meaning that
buy and sell limit orders are generated at random by traders. Traders ﬁrst determine whether they are a
buyer or seller at random, and then place a limit buy or sell order determined by their budget constraints. These limit prices in each case are generated as random variables. In contrast to the previous markets, these
traders are generally fairly unsophisticated. As in the study by Cont & Bouchaud (2000) they exhibit a kind
of herding behavior. Buyers and sellers group into larger dependent sets, which then move together. The Genoa artiﬁcial stock market has an interesting market-clearing property. The limit orders are all
37Genetic programing is discussed in Brenner (2005) and Duﬀy (2005). There have been some implementations of this
technology on actual data as in Neely, Weller & Dittmar (1997) and Allen & Karjalainen (1998). The origins of genetic
programming go back to Koza (1992). 38This is the recurring theme of individual versus social learning; see Vriend (2000). 23",Incorrect,The answer provided does not address the question and shows a lack of knowledge on the topic.
How do you think the token gifts motivate the speakers?,"The token gifts, such as USB thumb drives and handmade coffee mugs, serve as a form of recognition and appreciation for the speakers at the event. These gifts can motivate the speakers to continue participating in future events and contribute to the success of the organization. Overall, the gesture of giving token gifts helps to build a positive relationship between the speakers and the organization.",".

place in 2008 in Portland, but the Oregon Section swapped meeting years with the  Vancouver Island 
Section in order to better coordinate the district and quad meetings (a w in-win situation for both 
Sections). The District 6 meeting was a huge success in that it attracted over 500 at tendees. The committee,

The current system fails to prevent harassment effectively and provide victims with adequate remedies.","Maurice Blackburn Lawyers submission to the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces .

i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5. This means that an individual, who may (and often does) have limited access to the law, is 
obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the  AHRC , in order to seek redress. This 
process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without l egal advice. We will return to 
our concerns regarding the current system  in our discussion on the Complaints Process. It can also be daunting for victims who are emotionally distressed, unfamiliar with legal 
processes, fearful of reprisal, and who are un sure of their legal rights. Further, women who 
are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career 
mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9. That means that in 83 percent of cases, the victims did not make a complaint for a whole 
host of reasons. These statistics demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases the current 
legislative scheme  has both failed to prevent the conduct through deterrence, and has failed 
to address the conduct through providing victims with access to an adequate remedy. Under the current scheme, an employer’s obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent 
sexual h arassment only becomes relevant where they are defending a claim of sexual 
harassment  - that is, after the harassment and the harm have already occurred10. Specifically, under s106 of the SDA an employer can escape vicarious liability for sexual 
harassmen t, where it can establish that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the sexual 
harassment from occurring11. 5 Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, P arliament of Australia, Half Way to Equal: Report of the 
Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia  (1992) (‘Halfway to Equal Report’).

3. The drivers of workplace sexual harassment, including whether: some individuals 
are more likely to experience sexual harassment due to particular characteristics 
including gender, age, sexual orientation, culturally or linguistically diverse 
background, Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander status or disability, and some 
workplace characteristics and practices are more likely to increase the risk  of sexual 
harassment. Maurice Blackburn’s staff regularly assist clients who have experience d sexual harassment 
or sex -based discrimination. Every day, w e witness the serious and damaging effect it can have on a person and a 
workplace. ABS data2 sugg ests that one in two women (53% or 5 million) and one in four men (25% or 
2.2 million) have experienced sexual harassment during their lifetime. In the last 12 months, 
one in six women (17% or 1.6 million) and one in eleven men (9.3% or 836,700) experience d

 union officials, politicians, barristers and labour l awyers, to facilitate a discussion about the 
most effective legislative reforms to secure justice for victims of sexual harassment. These 
round table discussions allowed Maurice Blackburn to draw from the knowledge of other 
highly experienced professionals  working in employment law and industrial relations, in 
formulating this submission. These key themes are explored in more detail in the following pages. We also refer the 
AHRC to the joint statement submitted by over 100 organisations including Maurice 
Blackburn and the submission to this inquiry from Women Lawyers NSW, which addresses 
some of these matters in more detail (and with which representatives of Maurice Blackburn

Businesses are already required by legislation to report on key gender equality indicators to 
WGEA annually. We are of the view that as part of this reporting, businesses should also be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment. Further, r eporting to Board and senior management level (in smaller business) must also be  
mandated if real cultural change is to occur. Whilst we acknowledge that the figure reported will not be representative of the true number 
of instances of sexual harassment given the very low reporting rates, we are of the view that 
this measure would c reate an important incentive for large businesses, and their senior 
managers, to take their obligation to prevent sexual harassment seriously.

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by hindering the understanding of settlement outcomes and compensation levels. This lack of data leads to inaccuracies in reported settlements, making it difficult for complainants to assess the potential outcomes of their complaints. Better settlement data needs to be obtained and published to provide clarity on available remedies for victims of sexual harassment.","The Complaints Process  
 
In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants. Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives. Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process  
 
These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to

The Mediation Process  
 
Model of Mediation  
 
The study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald23 found that a number of 
factors influenced the outcome including differences in the manner in which mediators  
conducted the mediation , whether the complainant had found another job and of course 
the level of harm and distress they had suffered. It is our  observation that the approach taken to mediation in the AHRC is for a mediator 
to take a light touch and express no view as to the merits of a claim or, conversely, as to 
the potential liability and risk of a respondent to a claim. In our view, a more rob ust 
approach to mediation  should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at 
mediation. Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.

 ------------This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour. In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time. While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in 
dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment matters, Maurice Blackburn is of t he 
view that a higher level of certainty with respect to how the mediation  conferences are 
conducted  should be given to complainants. Currently, participation in the mediation  process with the AHRC is voluntary for 
respondents. In our observation this le ads to claimants being further traumatised by the 
actions of their employers  - who either do not file a response or do not attend mediation  
or prevaricate regarding same . Maurice Blackburn is of the view that in order to encourage respondents and employe rs 
to participate in the mediation  process in meaningful, constructive and useful way, the 
AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the 
mediation  conference and to file a reply document in a specified period of time. Maurice Blackburn  further submits that the AHRC should consider the establishment of a 
victim advocate role within the AHRC  to represent individuals at mediation s where those 
individuals  cannot achieve  access to justice . We recognise that this service woul d need to be 
subject to some form of means test and/or other criteria  (by way of example - refugee status,

 the lack of data available given claims that are settled are often the subject of 
confidentially terms21 or se ttled outside (including after) the AHRC process and not 
reported. The scarcity of data and the deficiencies in the currently published data have led to a 
situation where a significant barrier to commencing proceedings or filing a complaint is 
the inaccu racy of the quantum of reported settlements. It is our experience that men and women who have experienced sexual harassment in 
the workplace will obtain settlements well into the 6 figure mark as a result of mediation 
or private negotiations. Despite t his, the data reported on the AHRC website (which appears to have last been 
updated in 2016), together with, a study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and 
Macdonald22 found that during mediation  financial compensation was paid in 72 percent 
of cases they ex amined, with the median quantum being $7000.00. Better settlement data (including on post mediation outcomes) needs to be obtained, 
maintained and published by the AHRC so that complainants can understand that there 
are available remedies which sound in real compensation being negotiated that may go 
some way to compensating the victims of sexual harassment for the hurt, humiliation, 
distress and financial losses that they have suffered. Employer tactics  
 
In addition, a tactic commonly used by employers to drive up complainant’s costs or to 
discourage commencement in court is to make very low offers at the mediation  stage, 
irrespective of their risk exposure . This is done  on the assumption that complainants  
cannot afford to pursue the complaints process past mediation. Given there is no risk of the imposition of a fine or a penalty, there is little incentive for 
employers to make reasonable settlement offers early in the mediation  stage. Accordingly, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the SDA should be amended so that in 
addition to compensation, penalties are also payable by respondents who are found 
liable for sexual harassment. Penalties are a common feature of the industrial relat ions landscape in Australia  and 
would have a necessary deterrent effect . They would also overcome the challenge many 
complainants face (especially those who are low paid and can therefore expect a lower 
award of damages for economic loss) of having little leverage during the mediation 
process, especially if they are not financially placed to engage in lengthy and costly 
litigation. 21 Worley, Charlesworth and Mc Donald (2013)  ‘Why do some sexual harassment complaints settle while others 
don’t?’ Alternative Law Journal 38(2), 96 -102. 22 Ibid.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It highlights the importance of settlement data in understanding outcomes and compensation levels, and suggests a solution to improve clarity for victims of sexual harassment."
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, according to Maurice Blackburn, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm. They believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace. Maurice Blackburn also suggests amending the legislated timeframe for making complaints through AHRC to be more in line with other jurisdictions.","This includes observations on the variou s pieces of legislation which 
make up the current framework, the complaints and appeals processes, and the assistance 
available to victims. The impacts on victims can be life long and life changing. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the signif icant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail 
in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. We believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully 
aware of the incidence of sexual haras sment in their workplace, and that they should be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their 
reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’). We believe that the current legislated tim eframe for making a complaint through AHRC is 
unworkable and out of step with other legislative provisions. It should be amended to 6 years 
in line with other employment law jurisdictions. We believe that the Australian Human Rights 
Commission Act 1986 (th e AHRC Act) or regulations should be amended to expressly 
prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences. We believe that other authorities, such as State and Territory Work, Health and Safety 
regulators, along with trade unions and con sumer advocates, could and should have a 
greater role to play in addressing and stamping out workplace sexual harassment. Above all, we believe that the AHRC should be properly funded and fully staffed in order to 
fulfil its statutory objectives and enab le it to more swiftly and robustly perform its vital role in 
resolving claims of sexual harassment in the workplace. In preparing this submission, Maurice Blackburn has engaged with a number of 
organisations such as NOW Australia and Unions NSW, who share  our goal of preventing 
sexual harassment from occurring in Australian workplaces and securing justice for victims. Specifically, Maurice Blackburn, NOW Australia and Unions NSW hosted a roundtable with

It mentions the onus on victims to seek redress, lack of obligation on employers to prevent harm, and the suggestion of enforceable sanctions. Additionally, it highlights the proposed amendment to the legislated timeframe for making complaints through AHRC."
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized when the abuser intends to cause harm, the victim reasonably expects harm, and the individual suffers serious emotional distress. A legislative framework is needed to hold abusers, employers, and online platforms accountable for online harassment. It is important to provide legal tools for victims to seek relief and damages in cases of online sexual harassment."," Immediacy. Responding to on -line media does not encourage introspection or the 
tempering of language  or behaviour .  The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration. We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages. This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms. We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material. We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress. Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.  That t he statutory body can order that offending materials be removed  from an on -line 
platform , and require a  correction and/or an apology.  That the frameworks allows  for the release of the identity of  anonymous abusers.  That on -line sexual harassment is criminalise d where : 
o the abuser intends a digital communication to cause harm,  
o a person  would reasonably expect the person in the position of the victim to 
be harmed, and

 o the individual suffers serious emotional distress. Our s ubmission s in response to ToR 1 : 
 
Maurice Blackburn submits that changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online 
workplace -related sexual and sex -based harassment  must include enforceable sanctions 
against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. Maurice Blackburn encourages the AHRC  to consider ways that employers can assist in 
creating a workplace where exposure to discus sion and engagement  via social media 
platforms does not impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment. We encourage the AHRC  to reimagin e how a criminal code and  a civil regime to combat on-
line sexual harassment  in Australia might be implemented. We submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it  is 
important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:  
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual 
harassment , and 
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online  
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to  monitor and 
protect users. 2.

 ------------Maurice Blackburn Lawyers submission to the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces . Page 4 
 There appears to be clear differences in the impacts of interaction with the readership, 
between on -line and traditional media functions. These include:  
 
 Anonymity. Reports suggest that anonymity may be a determining factor in whether 
on-line input is threatening, abusive or personal. It seems probable that the ability to 
hide behind anonymity might be an enabler of on-line sexual harassment . Jour nalists, 
on the other hand, are encouraged to use their own names. This inequality is 
concerning in the workplace context.

 7. Recommendations to address sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. Maurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations:  
 
1. That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace -related 
sexual and sex -based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against 
employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. 2. That AHRC should  consider ways that  employers can assist in creating a workplace 
where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not 
impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment. 3. That AHRC  investigate  how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on -line 
sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented. 4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on -line sexual 
harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools 
to allow them to:  
 Seek inj unctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on -line sexual 
harassment, and  
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online 
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to 
monitor and prote ct users. 5.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of when online sexual harassment should be criminalized, mentioning the intent to cause harm, victim's expectation of harm, and serious emotional distress.
