 ------------this new ﬁnancial rigor.2In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center
of a change in thinking about ﬁnancial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which
agents may diﬀer in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information,
their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.
Models in the realm of agent-based computational ﬁnance view ﬁnancial markets as interacting groups
of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand
the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would
be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3It is important to distinguish agent-based models
from other more general heterogeneous agent models in ﬁnance, since the latter have been part of the ﬁeld

The papers described in this section are more computational than those mentioned previously. In most
cases the small sets of tractable trading rules are replaced with larger sets of strategies, which are usually
represented using various computational techniques. These will be referred to as many-type models. This
ﬁrst section concentrates on applications where the economic environment is well understood and where there
is often a simple homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium which gives a useful benchmark comparison.
Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement.

a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest.

What is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'?,"Investor heterogeneity refers to the differences in characteristics, preferences, and strategies among investors in the market.

In the mid to later part of the 20th century, ﬁnance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the eﬃcient
markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the
ﬁeld on a new, solid scientiﬁc foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were
powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders,
leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset
pricing, eﬃcient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing
to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for

 ------------agent-based ﬁnancial market models without detailed speciﬁcations for trading strategies could be replicated
using more empirically-based micro trading mechanisms.49
Much simpler models have been implemented using an order-book trading mechanism with the goal of
replicating empirical features of actual market data. One example of this is Chiarella & Iori (2002). This
is a few-type model with technical, fundamental, and noise traders placing orders in an electronic order
book system. They show that the interaction of these three types generates realistic price series, and trading
activity. Just how much agent complication is necessary to replicate high frequency features in ﬁnancial time
series is a question which is addressed in Farmer et al. (2005). This is not exactly an agent-based market

These questions often lack guidance, but are crucial for building realistic markets. Policy questions related to market design and microstructure are well-suited for agent-based approaches.","The remainder of this chapter will summarize recent work on agent-based computational models in
ﬁnance. The next section introduces some of the computational tools and design issues that are important
in building markets. Section 3 covers artiﬁcial market models that attempt to recreate an entire market.
Section 4 covers a few other types of markets which do not ﬁt into the earlier categories. Section 5 covers
some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.

 ------------4 Other markets
This sections covers several ﬁnancial market models which are diﬀerent from those considered above. Among
these are markets which consider detailed trading institutions and learning market makers, and also models
which consider the coevolution of strategies and ﬁnancial securities.
Most of the markets considered up to now have abstracted away from actual trading institutions. This
is somewhat of a puzzle in the agent-based ﬁnance world, since a bottom up approach would appear to call
for starting from the basics of how trades are executed. Most models build stylized economic structures that
avoid the institutional details of trading. However, research has begun appearing which implements more
realistic trading systems.48Market design and market microstructure questions appear to be well suited for
agent-based approaches. First, large amount of data are available. Second, there are critical policy questions

 ------------construction and design of these same trading mechanisms. In some of these markets it is the institutions
that are at the center of the investigation, and the agents are just a mechanism for testing their behavior.
Some of the policy questions addressed in this work are much more sharply deﬁned than in other agent-based
models. An example of this would be the explorations into decimalization on markets, or the implementation
of price limits. From a policy perspective this would seem to be a very natural place for the ﬁeld to move as
it matures.
Up to this point very little reference has been made to the growing literature on behavioral ﬁnance.
It is important to deﬁne where agent-based ﬁnancial markets sit relative to this larger ﬁeld. First, they
are clearly behavioral models themselves, since the agents are boundedly rational and follow simple rules of
thumb. This is a key characteristic of any behavioral model, and agent-based models have this characteristic.",Correct,The answer provides a comprehensive list of different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market. It also explains the importance of these questions in building realistic markets and highlights the suitability of agent-based approaches for policy questions related to market design and microstructure.
Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves using the optimal linear functional form for agent i, represented by the formula si=αi(¯d−p). The agents need to learn the optimal α parameter for their portfolios. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to estimate fitness values for each agent over a period of time.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)

 ------------3.2 Model dynamics under learning
The papers described in this section are more computational than those mentioned previously. In most
cases the small sets of tractable trading rules are replaced with larger sets of strategies, which are usually
represented using various computational techniques. These will be referred to as many-type models. This
ﬁrst section concentrates on applications where the economic environment is well understood and where there
is often a simple homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium which gives a useful benchmark comparison.
Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement.
The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in
a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model

The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t/p2,t. Agents' demand for savings is given by st=m1,t/p1,t+m2,t/p2,t=1/2(w1−w2)/(Rt). The model has multiple equilibria, and the final exchange rate depends on the starting value.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal.
Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.

 ------------together, and the ﬁttest two of this set are put into the next generation’s population. This is known as
theelection operator , which was ﬁrst used in Arifovic (1994). It is designed to make sure that evolution
continues to progress to higher ﬁtness levels.
Arifovic analyzes the dynamics of this market for various parameter values. The results show that the
ﬁrst-period consumption level converges to a stable value close to the optimum. However, the exchange rate
continues to move over time, never settling to any constant value. There is an interesting interpretation
for this dynamic price process. In the equilibrium the return on the two assets is the same, so the learning
agents are indiﬀerent between holding the two currencies. Groups of agents move to holding one currency or
another, the exchange rate moves around as they shift demands between currencies. In a model such as this,
it is clear that a constant exchange rate equilibrium can only be maintained through some mechanism that

 ------------to various parameter speciﬁcations.
Estimation of few-type models has been a much more common activity, and has already yielded some
interesting early results. The simpler structure of these models permits their conversion into tractable, albeit
nonlinear, time series structures. Vigfusson (1997) is one of the ﬁrst papers to estimate one of these models.
The framework is based on a model by Frankel & Froot (1988) for studying exchange rate movements, which
was mentioned in section 3.1 and is also covered by Hommes (2005). The model is implemented empirically as
a Markov switching model, as in Engel & Hamilton (1990), where the two states correspond to fundamental
and chartist regimes. Exchange rate predictions are generated as a weighted average of the two diﬀerent
regimes, where the weights are given by conditional probabilities of the two states. Some general support is
given to the diﬀerent conditional forecasts in diﬀerent states of the world, but some of the results are mixed.

 ------------that is used is the foreign exchange model of Kareken & Wallace (1981). This is a two-country, two-period,
overlapping generations model. Agents have income and consumption in both periods of their lives. Agents’
only means for saving income from the ﬁrst to the second period of their lives is through either country’s
currency.
Agents maximize a two-period log utility function subject to their budget constraints as in,

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based market models face criticisms such as the complexity of agents not necessarily leading to better performance. Another criticism is the assumption of a small number of assets, limiting the model's ability to capture all relevant features. Additionally, the lack of general principles for constructing agent-based market models is a challenge that may improve as the field evolves.","complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment.
This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism.
Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well
to models with a single representative risky asset. Questions naturally arise about calibrating to aggregate

 ------------Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves.
(Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more

 ------------The remainder of this chapter will summarize recent work on agent-based computational models in
ﬁnance. The next section introduces some of the computational tools and design issues that are important
in building markets. Section 3 covers artiﬁcial market models that attempt to recreate an entire market.
Section 4 covers a few other types of markets which do not ﬁt into the earlier categories. Section 5 covers
some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive discussion of the criticisms of agent-based markets, highlighting issues such as complexity of agents, limited asset representation, and the lack of general principles. The response is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an ignored final problem because complaints are dealt with at an unsatisfactorily slow rate, causing complainants to feel fatigued and worn down by the process. Maurice Blackburn suggests amending the AHRC Act to prescribe time frames for scheduling mediation conferences to address this issue. There is no evidence to suggest that claims made more than six months after the alleged events are less meritorious.","is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in

 There is no sound policy reason for the new time limit . 
 
At the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward 
by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate 
unmeritorious  or vexatious  claims being made14.  
 
The JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related 
to complaint handling  activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15. However, this 
recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a 
complaint16.  
 
Indeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the  
President’s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none 
of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for 
lodging a complaint.

 ------------there is no a priori argument for any particular history length. This greatly complicates the evolutionary
process, and distances these problems from those often considered in the evolutionary computation literature.
2.4 Information representation
One of the biggest problems in market design is how information is presented to the agents, and how they
process it. Theoretically, this is the daunting task of converting large amounts of time series information
from several series into a concise plan for trading. To handle this researchers are often forced to predeﬁne a
set of information variables as well as the functional structure used to convert these into trading strategies. A
second problem is how information is revealed about securities. Are there special signals visible only to certain
agents? Are there costly information variables? How frequent are information releases? Unfortunately, there
are no easy answers to these questions.

 ------------There is no evidence which suggest s claims that are mad e more than six months after 
the alleged events took place are less meritorious than those that are made before this 
time period.  
 
In fact, to the contrary, it is well documented that victims of sexual harassment may face 
a number of hurdles in bringing a  complaints in short time periods for a number of 
reasons, including the emotional and psychological impact the conduct often has them.17   
 
Of the 17 percent of people who made a complaint to their supervisor, the majority of 
complaints were made shortly a fter the events occurred. The statistics in relation to the 
timing of reporting sexual harassment were set out comprehensively by the AHRC in the 
Fourth Report, and are illustrated in the graph below.

It goes into detail about complaints being dealt with slowly and suggests a solution, but does not explain how timing is an ignored final problem. Additionally, the answer seems to be more focused on a specific context rather than providing a general explanation."

of this event to our friends in Vancouver, BC. The Quad meeting was originally s cheduled to take 
place in 2008 in Portland, but the Oregon Section swapped meeting years with the  Vancouver Island 
Section in order to better coordinate the district and quad meetings (a w in-win situation for both 
Sections).

 ------------all the rules that encode the least proﬁtable strategies with rules that encode the most proﬁtable strategy.
Then a mutation operator is applied to all rules.
The investors are encoded as bitstrings. The two investors maintain a price table that indicates the price
that they will pay for each possible security. The investor has a table of 80 possible pricing strategies for
each security. In each round, each investor choses a pricing strategy at random from the appropriate security
table after the ﬁrm has decided on the security that it will issue.52The security goes to the highest bidder in
each round. The proﬁtability of the strategy from the investor’s perspective is recorded, and the populations
are adjusted with a selection procedure in which the 10 worst strategies are replaced by the 10 best. At this
point the GA is applied to the population with crossover, mutation, and the election operator.

 ------------current set of forecasting rules for the next period and with probability (1 −p) leaves his current set of
forecasting rules unchanged. The probability, p, is an important model parameter that determines the
average number of periods between learning for each trader as a function K=K(p). This Kis referred
to as the “learning rate.” Learning takes place with a modiﬁed genetic algorithm (GA) designed to handle
both the real and binary components of the rule sets. The worst performing 15 percent of the rules are
dropped out of an agent’s rule set, and are replaced by new rules. New rules are generated using a genetic
algorithm with uniform crossover and mutation. For the bitstring part of the rules, crossover chooses two ﬁt
rules as parents, and takes bits from each parent’s rule string at random.35Mutation involves changing the
individual bits at random. Crossover also is implemented on the real components of the forecasting rules",Incorrect,The answer provided does not accurately describe the standard rules of a golf game. The response seems to be describing a different type of game involving bidding on securities and genetic algorithms. The standard rules of a golf game typically involve hitting a ball into a series of holes on a course using the fewest number of strokes.
How do you think the token gifts motivate the speakers?,"The token gifts, such as discounts at meetings, likely motivate speakers by providing a tangible benefit for their participation. These gifts can serve as a form of recognition and appreciation for their contributions. Additionally, the discounts may incentivize speakers to continue participating in future events.","This year, students continued to enjoy substantial discounts at  Oregon ITE Section meetings ranging

 ------------Most of the papers considered in this survey could loosely be considered part of the investment side of
ﬁnance. There is no consideration for the issuance of securities by ﬁrms, or the design and evolution of
securities themselves. A recent exception is Noe, Rebello & Wang (2003) which represents the ﬁrst paper to
consider corporate ﬁnance issues in an agent-based framework. The authors are interested in the problem of
which securities ﬁrms will issue to raise investment capital, and how investors learn to price these securities.
Firms need to issue securities that maximize their proﬁts, but cannot do this independent of investors’ pricing
strategies. On the other hand, investors must learn how to price and evaluate the securities issued by ﬁrms,
but they can only do this for securities they have seen in the past. The importance of this coevolutionary
process of ﬁrm and investor learning turns out to be critical in the authors’ model.

 ------------The theoretical parts of eﬃcient markets ideas have been attacked for quite some time. One of the most
important questions for market eﬃciency comes from Grossman & Stiglitz (1980). Here, agents have the
choice of purchasing an information signal on a ﬁnancial asset. In a perfectly eﬃcient world with a small
cost on the signal, no one would have an incentive to buy the signal. However, if no one bought the signal,
how did the market get informationally eﬃcient in the ﬁrst place? It is interesting to note that many of the
papers mentioned here, and in Hommes (2005), are based on the paradoxical structure of this model. More
recently, the literature on noise trading, [e. g., DeLong, Shleifer, Summers & Waldmann (1990)], introduced
the important idea that risk averse rational types may not be able to “take over” the dynamics from less
rational strategies, since they trade less aggressively because they are sensitive to the risk induced by the

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces persists despite legislation like the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers suggest that a positive obligation on employers to prevent harassment would be more effective. They recommend enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace.,"9 Everyone’s business: Fourth National Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces , p63.

i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful

 7. Recommendations to address sexual harassment in Australian workplaces.  
 
Maurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations:  
 
1. That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace -related 
sexual and sex -based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against 
employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
2. That AHRC should  consider ways that  employers can assist in creating a workplace 
where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not 
impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment.  
 
3. That AHRC  investigate  how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on -line 
sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented.  
 
4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on -line sexual",Correct,The student accurately highlights the persistence of sexual harassment in Australian workplaces despite existing legislation. They also correctly mention the recommendation for enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace.
What legislative suggestions pertaining to workplace sexual harassment does the firm provide in its submission?,"The firm suggests that businesses should be required to report incidents of sexual harassment as part of their annual gender equality reporting. They also propose mandating reporting to Board and senior management levels in smaller businesses to drive cultural change. Additionally, Maurice Blackburn recommends enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace and encourages reimagining criminal and civil regimes to combat online sexual harassment.","Submission in Response

 union officials, politicians, barristers and labour l awyers, to facilitate a discussion about the 
most effective legislative reforms to secure justice for victims of sexual harassment. These 
round table discussions allowed Maurice Blackburn to draw from the knowledge of other 
highly experienced professionals  working in employment law and industrial relations, in 
formulating this submission.  
 
These key themes are explored in more detail in the following pages. We also refer the

Businesses are already required by legislation to report on key gender equality indicators to 
WGEA annually. We are of the view that as part of this reporting, businesses should also be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment.  
 
Further, r eporting to Board and senior management level (in smaller business) must also be  
mandated if real cultural change is to occur.  
 
Whilst we acknowledge that the figure reported will not be representative of the true number 
of instances of sexual harassment given the very low reporting rates, we are of the view that 
this measure would c reate an important incentive for large businesses, and their senior 
managers, to take their obligation to prevent sexual harassment seriously.

Our s ubmission s in response to ToR 1 : 
 
Maurice Blackburn submits that changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online 
workplace -related sexual and sex -based harassment  must include enforceable sanctions 
against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
Maurice Blackburn encourages the AHRC  to consider ways that employers can assist in 
creating a workplace where exposure to discus sion and engagement  via social media 
platforms does not impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment.  
 
We encourage the AHRC  to reimagin e how a criminal code and  a civil regime to combat on-
line sexual harassment  in Australia might be implemented.  
 
We submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it  is",Correct,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the legislative suggestions provided by the firm regarding workplace sexual harassment, including reporting requirements, sanctions for non-compliance, and measures to combat online harassment."
How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by hindering the ability to assess outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. This lack of data contributes to delays in scheduling complaints for mediation, causing complainants to feel fatigued and prolonging their trauma. To address this, setting time frames for scheduling mediation conferences could help expedite the process and provide timely resolution for complainants.","Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives.  
 
Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process  
 
These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to

 ------------is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in

The Mediation Process  
 
Model of Mediation  
 
The study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald23 found that a number of 
factors influenced the outcome including differences in the manner in which mediators  
conducted the mediation , whether the complainant had found another job and of course 
the level of harm and distress they had suffered.  
 
It is our  observation that the approach taken to mediation in the AHRC is for a mediator 
to take a light touch and express no view as to the merits of a claim or, conversely, as to 
the potential liability and risk of a respondent to a claim. In our view, a more rob ust 
approach to mediation  should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at 
mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC,

 ------------Macdonald22 found that during mediation  financial compensation was paid in 72 percent 
of cases they ex amined, with the median quantum being $7000.00.  
 
Better settlement data (including on post mediation outcomes) needs to be obtained, 
maintained and published by the AHRC so that complainants can understand that there 
are available remedies which sound in real compensation being negotiated that may go 
some way to compensating the victims of sexual harassment for the hurt, humiliation, 
distress and financial losses that they have suffered.  
 
 
Employer tactics  
 
In addition, a tactic commonly used by employers to drive up complainant’s costs or to 
discourage commencement in court is to make very low offers at the mediation  stage, 
irrespective of their risk exposure . This is done  on the assumption that complainants  
cannot afford to pursue the complaints process past mediation.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It also offers a solution to address the issue, showing a good understanding of the topic."
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme is the failure to increase caps over time, making damages recoverable inadequate for deterring offenders and compensating victims. Maurice Blackburn suggests abolishing statutory caps on damages under state legislation to align with federal jurisdiction. The current legislative scheme places the burden on victims to seek redress for harm suffered, rather than imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent harassment.","damages pursu ant to s s127(b)(i) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984  (WA).  
 
Given average weekly earnings of women have increased eight times since the enactment of 
the ADA, the failure of the legislature to increase the caps over time, has rendered the 
quantum of damag es recoverable pursuant to these caps manifestly inadequate in both 
deterring offenders and compensating victims for harm they have suffered20.   
 
Further, the effect of the statutory caps is that only the very worst examples of sexual 
harassment attract an  award of damages of this magnitude. Maurice Blackburn is of the view 
that statutory caps on damages under state legislation should be abolished to reflect the 
federal jurisdiction.  
 
vi. The Complaints Process  
 
In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants.

 ------------First, the area has many open questions that more standard modeling approaches have not been able to
resolve. Second there is a large amount of ﬁnancial data available for testing. It will be interesting to see if,
sometime in the future, ﬁnancial economists eventually replace the stylized theories of equilibrium market
dynamics with a more realistic picture of the continuing struggle of learning and adapting agents who push
markets in the direction of eﬃciency, even though they never quite reach this goal.

i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful

 ------------sexual harassment, whom typically have restricted access to the law, the opportunity to 
engage in a relatively low co st, less adversarial dispute resolution process.  
 
Maurice Blackburn submits the Amendment should be repealed and that the time for making 
complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law  jurisdictions.  
 
This submission is made fo r the following reasons : 
  
 There is no sound policy reason for imposing  the time period on complaints;  
 
 A six -month time period is out of step with other Australian employment  law 
jurisdictions; and   
 
 Reducing access to an informal, low -cost dispute resolu tion process has a negative 
impact on the efficient resolution of complaints.  
 
These are elaborated upon below:",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of one significant failing of the current legislative scheme, which is the failure to increase caps over time. It also suggests a solution to abolish statutory caps on damages under state legislation. Additionally, it highlights the burden placed on victims to seek redress instead of imposing an obligation on employers to prevent harassment."
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized when the abuser intends to cause harm through digital communication, when harm is reasonably expected by the victim, and when serious emotional distress is suffered by the individual. The submission suggests that a legislative framework should include regulation, criminal sanctions, and a civil regime to hold abusers, employers, and online platforms accountable for enabling or causing online sexual harassment. It is important to criminalize particularly nefarious behaviors and provide resources for successful prosecution to combat online sexual harassment effectively."," That on -line sexual harassment is criminalise d where : 
o the abuser intends a digital communication to cause harm,  
o a person  would reasonably expect the person in the position of the victim to 
be harmed, and

 ------------via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and

We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.  
 
Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.  
 
 That t he statutory body can order that offending materials be removed  from an on -line 
platform , and require a  correction and/or an apology.  
 
 That the frameworks allows  for the release of the identity of  anonymous abusers.",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of when online sexual harassment should be criminalized according to the submission.

Additionally, it mentions the need for a legislative framework including regulation, criminal sanctions, and civil regime to hold accountable those enabling or causing online sexual harassment. The response also emphasizes the importance of criminalizing specific behaviors and providing resources for successful prosecution to combat online sexual harassment effectively."
