Well done."
Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because participants in these markets continuously learn from past experiences and adjust their strategies accordingly. Bounded rationality refers to the idea that individuals make decisions based on limited information and cognitive abilities, leading to imperfect decision-making. This combination of learning and bounded rationality influences the behavior of market participants and ultimately shapes the dynamics of financial markets.",,Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of why financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents. It effectively discusses how participants in financial markets continuously learn and adjust their strategies based on past experiences, as well as the concept of bounded rationality in decision-making."
Why are the financial markets appealing applications for agent-based methods?,Financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods because they involve a large number of interacting agents with varying behaviors and strategies. Agent-based methods can capture the complexity and dynamics of financial markets more accurately compared to traditional models. These methods can simulate the interactions between agents and provide insights into market behavior and outcomes.,,Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of why financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods. It highlights the key points regarding the large number of interacting agents, varying behaviors and strategies, as well as the ability of agent-based methods to capture complexity and dynamics more accurately than traditional models."
What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"Some design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the types of agents involved, defining their behaviors and decision-making processes, and establishing the rules governing interactions between agents. Other considerations may include the level of heterogeneity among agents, the information available to them, and the market structure in which they operate. Overall, designing an agent-based financial market involves balancing realism with computational efficiency to create a model that accurately reflects real-world dynamics.",,Correct,The student has provided a comprehensive answer outlining various design questions involved in constructing an agent-based financial market. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively explains the key considerations in designing such a market.
Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves using the optimal linear functional form for agent i, which simplifies the portfolio problem. Agents need to learn the optimal α for their portfolios. The genetic algorithm is used to estimate fitness values for each agent over a period.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)

 ------------Given the normally distributed dividend process, there is a well-known optimal solution to the portfolio
problem given by,
s∗=α∗(¯d−p) (4)
α∗=1
γσ2
d(5)
where σ2
dis the variance of the random dividend payout. The main exercise in Lettau’s paper is to see if and
when agents are able to learn this optimal portfolio strategy using a genetic algorithm. In general, agents’
policy functions could take the form of
s=s(¯d, p), (6)

The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t
p2,t. Agents care about the relative returns of the two currencies in terms of money holdings. The final exchange rate depends on the starting value in certain learning algorithms.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal.
Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.

 ------------single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms

The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in

 ------------balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency. This setup avoids some of the complexities that appear in other papers in ﬁnding prices.
The evolution of strategies is similar to Lettau (1997). The ﬁtness of a strategy is determined by its
ex post utility, and a new population is drawn using ﬁtness proportional selection. Agents are paired, and
a crossover operator is applied to each pair with a given probability generating two new children. When
crossover is not used, the children are direct copies of the parents. These children are then mutated by
ﬂipping bits with a certain probability. The ﬁtness of the new rules is then estimated by implementing them
on the previous round of prices and returns. At this point all four of the children and parents are grouped

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters with unclear impacts. Models often use a wide range of computational tools and methods, leading to complexity. Critics also point out that many models assume a small number of assets, limiting their realism and potential insights.","numbers are, but this is an interesting test of the minority game model on real data.54
5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.
Table 1 gives a short overview of the design structures of some of the agent-based ﬁnancial market models
described in this paper. This is far from being an all inclusive list, since many of the models described in this
chapter would not ﬁt well into the criteria for the list. This emphasizes what should have become clear from
the earlier sections: agent-based ﬁnancial models have been built using many diﬀerent features and designs.

 ------------arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment.
This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism.
Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well

 ------------Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves.
(Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more",Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the criticisms of agent-based markets, highlighting issues such as the presence of too many parameters with unclear impacts, the complexity arising from the use of various computational tools and methods, and the limitation in realism and insights due to assumptions of a small number of assets."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an important factor in decision-making, especially in settings where events can be assumed to happen simultaneously. Arbitrary timing decisions can significantly impact results, as seen in approaches like delayed price adjustments. In the context of evolving strategies, the timing of actions can have a substantial effect on outcomes.","make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In
the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on
arbitrary timing decisions is deﬁnitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed
price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It
is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the

 There is no sound policy reason for the new time limit . 
 
At the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward 
by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate 
unmeritorious  or vexatious  claims being made14.  
 
The JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related 
to complaint handling  activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15. However, this 
recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a 
complaint16.  
 
Indeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the  
President’s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none 
of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for 
lodging a complaint.

 ------------mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.",Incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address the question asked. It discusses the importance of timing in decision-making but does not explain how timing can be an ignored final problem. Additionally, the response lacks clarity and coherence."

The Student Liaison Committee had another successful year in attracting schools from the Pacific 
Northwest to compete in the Oregon Section's annual Traffic Bowl Competition. The Traffic Bowl is 
a Jeopardy-based trivia contest where students must answer ques tions on a variety of traffic and 
transportation trivia. This year the competition was held on Novem ber 15, 2007 at McMenamin's 
Edgefield just east of Portland, Oregon.  
This year we had 52 students from six universities attending the event. Par ticipating schools were:

 ------------balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency. This setup avoids some of the complexities that appear in other papers in ﬁnding prices.
The evolution of strategies is similar to Lettau (1997). The ﬁtness of a strategy is determined by its
ex post utility, and a new population is drawn using ﬁtness proportional selection. Agents are paired, and
a crossover operator is applied to each pair with a given probability generating two new children. When
crossover is not used, the children are direct copies of the parents. These children are then mutated by
ﬂipping bits with a certain probability. The ﬁtness of the new rules is then estimated by implementing them
on the previous round of prices and returns. At this point all four of the children and parents are grouped

 ------------The theoretical parts of eﬃcient markets ideas have been attacked for quite some time. One of the most
important questions for market eﬃciency comes from Grossman & Stiglitz (1980). Here, agents have the
choice of purchasing an information signal on a ﬁnancial asset. In a perfectly eﬃcient world with a small
cost on the signal, no one would have an incentive to buy the signal. However, if no one bought the signal,
how did the market get informationally eﬃcient in the ﬁrst place? It is interesting to note that many of the
papers mentioned here, and in Hommes (2005), are based on the paradoxical structure of this model. More
recently, the literature on noise trading, [e. g., DeLong, Shleifer, Summers & Waldmann (1990)], introduced
the important idea that risk averse rational types may not be able to “take over” the dynamics from less
rational strategies, since they trade less aggressively because they are sensitive to the risk induced by the",Correct,The answer provides a clear explanation of how token gifts motivate the speakers by recognizing and appreciating their efforts.

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces is a persistent issue despite legislation prohibiting it since 1984. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers believe that the current legislative scheme places the burden on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harassment. They recommend enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace and suggest investigating criminal and civil regimes to combat online sexual harassment.,"Maurice Blackburn Lawyers submission to the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces .

i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful

Maurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations:  
 
1. That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace -related 
sexual and sex -based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against 
employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
2. That AHRC should  consider ways that  employers can assist in creating a workplace 
where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not 
impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment.

There are a number of areas within the current legal framework where Maurice Blackburn

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by limiting the understanding of outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. This lack of data hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of the mediation process in resolving complaints. Without sufficient information on mediations, it is challenging to make informed decisions on improving the Complaints Process.","that statutory caps on damages under state legislation should be abolished to reflect the

vi. The Complaints Process  
 
In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants.  
 
Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives.  
 
Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:

It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to

 ------------mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It highlights the limitations in understanding outcomes and assessing effectiveness, as well as the challenges in making informed decisions for improvement."
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, as designated by the firm, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm.

rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the

In our view, it should be made abundantly clear, via legislative reform or through delegated 
legislation, that regulat ors are required to investigate sexual harassment complaints given 
the health and safety implications of same.  
 
We acknowledge that regulators are chronically understaffed and underfunded in many 
States and Territories and would encourage the establishmen t of a properly funded discrete 
directorate within WHS regulators aimed at investigating risks to health and safety arising 
from sexual harassment.  
 
In order to reduce the load on regulators, trade unions should also have the ability to 
prosecute for heal th and safety breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed.  
 
iii. Expanding company reporting requirements",Correct,"The student accurately identifies one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, which is the onus placed on victims to seek redress instead of obligating employers to prevent harm. The student also correctly mentions the firm's belief in enforceable sanctions against employers and increased reporting requirements on incidents of sexual harassment in workplaces."
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where individuals engage in particularly nefarious behaviors, causing, enabling, or exposing others to such harassment. This includes holding accountable not only the perpetrators but also employers and social media platforms. A legislative framework incorporating regulation, criminal sanctions, and civil remedies is necessary to address online sexual harassment effectively."," The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people

this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and

harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.  
 
Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.

 ------------line sexual harassment  in Australia might be implemented.  
 
We submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it  is 
important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:  
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual 
harassment , and 
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online  
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to  monitor and 
protect users.
