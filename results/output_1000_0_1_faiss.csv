"What is meant by ""computational finance""?",Computational finance refers to using computational power to analyze financial data and models. It involves viewing financial markets as groups of interacting agents with varying abilities and attitudes. The computer plays a central role in understanding the dynamics of these markets in agent-based computational models.,"to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for
this new ﬁnancial rigor.2In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center
of a change in thinking about ﬁnancial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which
agents may diﬀer in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information,
their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.
Models in the realm of agent-based computational ﬁnance view ﬁnancial markets as interacting groups
of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand
the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would",Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of computational finance, highlighting the use of computational power in analyzing financial data and models, as well as the role of computers in understanding market dynamics."
What is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'?,'Investor heterogeneity' refers to the diversity of agents or wealth across different strategies in agent-based financial markets. This dynamic heterogeneity plays a critical role in how optimizing agents respond to the distribution of strategies. The complexity of the state space often leads to bounded rationality for both agents and modelers.,"from other more general heterogeneous agent models in ﬁnance, since the latter have been part of the ﬁeld
for some time.4In agent-based ﬁnancial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is
represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a ﬁxed or changing set of strategies. In
principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in
general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form
of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded
rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual
agents. It is also important to remember that the simpliﬁed rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest
that the exercise is forcing some sort of simpliﬁed solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,",Correct,The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of 'investor heterogeneity' by describing it as the diversity of agents or wealth across different strategies in agent-based financial markets. It also mentions the critical role it plays in how optimizing agents respond to the distribution of strategies and the bounded rationality that arises due to the complexity of the state space.
What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?,"The revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century was driven by the advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula. These developments put the field on a new, solid scientific foundation based on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines. This computational dimension was supported by the early availability of large machine-readable data sets and the computational power to analyze them.","1 Introduction
In the mid to later part of the 20th century, ﬁnance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the eﬃcient
markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the
ﬁeld on a new, solid scientiﬁc foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were
powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders,
leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset
pricing, eﬃcient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing
to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for",Correct,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century, mentioning key developments such as the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula. It also highlights the shift towards a more scientific foundation and the role of computational analysis supported by data sets and computational power."
Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because key debates about market efficiency and rationality remain unresolved in finance. Additionally, financial time series present puzzles that are not well understood, leading to the need for agents to learn and adapt. The wealth of pricing and volume data in financial markets allows for analysis and approximation of fitness through wealth or return performance.","Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons.
First, the key debates in ﬁnance about market eﬃciency and rationality are still unresolved. Second, ﬁnancial
time series contain many curious puzzles that are not well understood. Third, ﬁnancial markets provide a
wealth of pricing and volume data that can be analyzed. Fourth, when considering evolution, ﬁnancial
markets provide a good approximation to a crude ﬁtness measure through wealth or return performance.
Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets.
Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market
eﬃciency has a strong theoretical and empirical backing which should not be ignored.5On the theoretical
side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents. It covers key debates, puzzles in financial time series, the need for agents to learn and adapt, and the use of pricing and volume data for analysis."
Why are the financial markets appealing applications for agent-based methods?,"Financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods because experiments can be done at reasonable time scales, making them more credible. Additionally, financial markets are well-suited for agent-based explorations due to their large, organized nature and the availability of rich data sets for testing models. Traditional approaches in finance are being questioned, and agent-based methods offer a possibility for solving empirical puzzles.","are given in Duﬀy (2005). Finance experiments are particularly appealing since they often can be done at
time scales that are reasonable for the real data. It is more credible that you can simulate a day of trading
in the laboratory, than to simulate someone’s entire life cycle.
To summarize, ﬁnancial markets are particularly well suited for agent-based explorations. They are
large well-organized markets for trading securities which can be easily compared. Currently, the established
theoretical structure of market eﬃciency and rational expectations is being questioned. There is a long list of
empirical features that traditional approaches have not been able to match. Agent-based approaches provide
an intriguing possibility for solving some of these puzzles.21Finally, ﬁnancial markets are rich in data sets
that can be used for testing and calibrating agent-based models. High quality data are available at many
frequencies, and in many diﬀerent forms.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods. It mentions the credibility of experiments, the organized nature of financial markets, the availability of rich data sets, and the potential for solving empirical puzzles."
What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the types of securities to be traded, the presence of fundamental value, and the scope of modeling (macro economy subset or specific financial market). These questions are crucial in shaping the economic environment of the market. Crafting these aspects in agent-based models can be complex due to the need for creating diverse and engaging worlds.","for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.
Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of
securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there
an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very speciﬁc ﬁnancial market? As in any
economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often
more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous",Correct,The answer provides a comprehensive list of different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market. It also explains the importance of these questions in shaping the economic environment of the market and acknowledges the complexity involved in crafting agent-based models.
Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves a financial market model with heterogeneous learning agents making portfolio choices. The model includes a risky asset with a given price and random dividend, as well as a risk-free asset. Agents' preferences exhibit constant absolute risk aversion, parameterized in the utility function. The framework is based on a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences.","Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement.
The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in
a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model
with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously
given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth
of agents is given by,
w=s(d−p), (2)
and their preferences are assumed to exhibit constant absolute risk aversion which can be parameterized as
in,
U(w) =−e−γw. (3)
This is clearly a very simpliﬁed market. No attempt is made to look at the feedback from agents’ demands",Correct,"The student has provided a clear and concise explanation of Lettau's framework, including the key components such as heterogeneous learning agents, risky and risk-free assets, constant absolute risk aversion, and myopic preferences. The use of mathematical formulae to explain the model is missing, which could further enhance the answer."
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t/p2,t. Agents care about the relative returns of the two currencies in terms of money holdings. The demand for savings is determined by the agents' maximization problem.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal.
Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.",Incorrect,The answer provided does not directly address the question asked. It would be more appropriate to provide a concise formula for the exchange rate.
Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters, with unclear impacts. Additionally, the use of various computational tools and methods in these models has made comparisons across platforms difficult. The diversity in design features and structures of agent-based financial models further complicates the evaluation and comparison process.","5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.
Table 1 gives a short overview of the design structures of some of the agent-based ﬁnancial market models
described in this paper. This is far from being an all inclusive list, since many of the models described in this
chapter would not ﬁt well into the criteria for the list. This emphasizes what should have become clear from
the earlier sections: agent-based ﬁnancial models have been built using many diﬀerent features and designs.
This is natural for a ﬁeld at this early stage, but it has made comparisons across market platforms diﬃcult.",Correct,"The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the criticisms of agent-based markets, highlighting issues such as the abundance of parameters, unclear impacts, challenges in comparisons due to computational tools, and the complexity arising from diverse design features and structures."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an ignored final problem due to the slow rate at which complaints are dealt with, causing complainants to feel fatigued and worn down. Complaints can take between 3 and 12 months to be scheduled for mediation, making it difficult for complainants to move on and overcome trauma. Maurice Blackburn suggests amending the AHRC Act to prescribe time frames for mediation conferences to address this issue.","is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in",Correct,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of why timing is considered an ignored final problem, citing the slow rate at which complaints are dealt with and suggesting a solution to address the issue."

What are the standard rules of a golf game?,I don't know.,"A second important innovation is the use of a common pool of rules, which the authors refer to as a
“business school.” This allows for some strategy learning to occur across agents in a very natural way.38
The rules in the common pool are evolved according to forecast accuracy. Traders then decide to update
their own strategies based on current performance. They draw rules from the common pool, comparing their
performance with their current rules. If the new rule is better they switch, but if they are unsuccessful after
several tries, they quit and stay with their current rule.

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces is peculiar due to the current legislation placing the onus on victims to seek redress rather than on employers to prevent harm. The Individual Complaint Model requires victims to make a complaint before pursuing a remedy for unlawful harassment. The persistent prevalence of sexual harassment suggests that the current legislation has failed in preventing such conduct.,"Page 7 
  
i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why sexual harassment is peculiar to Australian workplaces, highlighting the current legislation's focus on victims seeking redress rather than employers preventing harm. It also mentions the Individual Complaint Model and the failure of the legislation in preventing sexual harassment."
What legislative suggestions pertaining to workplace sexual harassment does the firm provide in its submission?,"The firm suggests implementing mandatory training on sexual harassment prevention for all employees. They also recommend establishing clear reporting procedures and support mechanisms for victims. Additionally, they propose stricter penalties for perpetrators of workplace sexual harassment.","Submission in Response 
to the National Inquiry into 
Sexual Harassment in 
Australian Workplaces  
 
 
February 2019",Correct,The student accurately identifies the legislative suggestions provided by the firm in its submission regarding workplace sexual harassment. The answer is detailed and covers all the key points mentioned in the question.
How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by limiting the understanding of outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. This lack of information hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of the mediation process in resolving complaints. Without sufficient data, it is challenging to make informed decisions and improvements to the Complaints Process.","complainants.  
 
Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives.  
 
Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process  
 
These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to 
                                                
19 Therese  MacDermott  (2015) ‘Reassessing Sexual Harassment: It's time’ Alternative Law Journal , 40(3), 157.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations affects the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It highlights the impact on understanding outcomes and assessing effectiveness, as well as the challenges in making informed decisions and improvements."
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, according to Maurice Blackburn, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm. They advocate for enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace. Additionally, they believe that the timeframe for making a complaint through AHRC should be amended to 6 years.","Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the signif icant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail 
in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
We believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully 
aware of the incidence of sexual haras sment in their workplace, and that they should be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their 
reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’).  
 
We believe that the current legislated tim eframe for making a complaint through AHRC is 
unworkable and out of step with other legislative provisions. It should be amended to 6 years",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of one significant failing of the current legislative scheme according to Maurice Blackburn. It also includes specific suggestions for improvement, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic."
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where particularly nefarious behaviors are involved, and when individuals engage in such behavior through online platforms. It is important to hold all those who cause, enable, or expose others to online sexual harassment accountable, including employers and social media platforms. Given the scope and pervasiveness of online sexual harassment, a concurrent civil process may be necessary to provide citizens with the tools needed for appropriate redress.","This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material.  
 
We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of when online sexual harassment should be criminalized, mentioning nefarious behaviors, engagement through online platforms, accountability of various parties, and the need for a civil process for redress."
