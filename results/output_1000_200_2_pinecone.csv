What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?,"The revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century was the shift towards globalization, deregulation, and the rise of financial technology. This period saw the emergence of new financial instruments, increased interconnectedness of global markets, and the growth of electronic trading platforms. Overall, it marked a significant transformation in the way financial markets operated and interacted on a global scale.",,Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century, covering key aspects such as globalization, deregulation, financial technology, new financial instruments, global market interconnectedness, and electronic trading platforms. The response effectively highlights the significant transformation in the operation and interaction of financial markets on a global scale."
Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because participants in these markets are constantly learning from past experiences and adjusting their strategies accordingly. Bounded rationality refers to the idea that individuals make decisions based on limited information and cognitive abilities, leading to behaviors that may not always be perfectly rational. This combination of learning and bounded rationality helps explain the dynamics and fluctuations observed in financial markets.",,Correct,The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of why financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents. It effectively highlights the role of learning from past experiences and the concept of bounded rationality in shaping market dynamics.
Why are the financial markets appealing applications for agent-based methods?,"Financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods because experiments can be conducted at reasonable time scales, making it more credible to simulate trading activities. Additionally, financial markets provide large, well-organized datasets that can be easily compared, making them suitable for agent-based explorations. Lastly, the nonlinear nature of financial markets poses a challenge for traditional econometric tools, making agent-based methods a valuable approach for modeling and forecasting market behavior.","behavior. Several of the models covered here have already done this, and more examples of using experiments
are given in Duﬀy (2005). Finance experiments are particularly appealing since they often can be done at
time scales that are reasonable for the real data. It is more credible that you can simulate a day of trading
in the laboratory, than to simulate someone’s entire life cycle.
To summarize, ﬁnancial markets are particularly well suited for agent-based explorations. They are
large well-organized markets for trading securities which can be easily compared. Currently, the established
theoretical structure of market eﬃciency and rational expectations is being questioned. There is a long list of
empirical features that traditional approaches have not been able to match. Agent-based approaches provide
an intriguing possibility for solving some of these puzzles.21Finally, ﬁnancial markets are rich in data sets

 ------------oﬀ unstable trajectories. As is well known, nonlinear systems can also be diﬃcult to forecast, and most of
the markets described here share this feature. Unfortunately, this may also make them diﬃcult to estimate
using traditional econometric tools. Agent-based modelers should be aware of these nonlinear issues, and
take them into account when evaluating market simulations.
Financial markets are an important challenge for agent-based computational modelers. Financial markets
may be one of the important early areas where agent-based methods show their worth, for two basic reasons.
41",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods. It highlights the ability to conduct experiments at reasonable time scales, access to large datasets, and the challenge posed by the nonlinear nature of financial markets for traditional econometric tools."
What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the economic environment, types of securities traded, and modeling the macro economy. These questions are complex and challenging, especially in crafting worlds of heterogeneous agents. The design of preferences is crucial but lacks clear guidance in agent-based modeling.","The remainder of this chapter will summarize recent work on agent-based computational models in
ﬁnance. The next section introduces some of the computational tools and design issues that are important
in building markets. Section 3 covers artiﬁcial market models that attempt to recreate an entire market.
Section 4 covers a few other types of markets which do not ﬁt into the earlier categories. Section 5 covers
some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.

 ------------This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.
Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of
securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there
an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very speciﬁc ﬁnancial market? As in any
economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often
more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous
agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building
representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design
question is probably the most important, and the most diﬃcult to give guidance on.
2.1 Preferences",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive list of different design questions involved in constructing an agent-based financial market. It also highlights the complexity and challenges faced in crafting worlds of heterogeneous agents. Additionally, it mentions the importance of preferences in agent-based modeling."
Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves using the optimal linear functional form for agent i, which is represented by the formula si=αi(¯d−p). Agents need to learn the optimal α for their portfolios. The genetic algorithm is used to estimate fitness values for each agent over a period of time.","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)

 ------------Given the normally distributed dividend process, there is a well-known optimal solution to the portfolio
problem given by,
s∗=α∗(¯d−p) (4)
α∗=1
γσ2
d(5)
where σ2
dis the variance of the random dividend payout. The main exercise in Lettau’s paper is to see if and
when agents are able to learn this optimal portfolio strategy using a genetic algorithm. In general, agents’
policy functions could take the form of
s=s(¯d, p), (6)
13",Correct,"The student has provided a clear explanation of Lettau's framework, including the optimal linear functional form and the use of genetic algorithm to estimate fitness values. The answer demonstrates understanding of the topic."
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t/p2,t. Agents' maximization problem yields demand for savings st=m1,t/p1,t+m2,t/p2,t=1/2(w1−w2)Rt. The final exchange rate depends on the starting value in certain learning algorithms.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal.
Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.

 ------------single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.
The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in",Incorrect,"The answer provided is not relevant to the question asked. It includes unrelated information about agents' maximization problem and learning algorithms, which are not related to the formula for calculating the exchange rate."
Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters with unclear impacts. Some models assume a small number of assets, limiting the complexity of trading strategies. The issue of detecting arbitrage opportunities with nonlinear strategies remains a significant concern for modelers.","numbers are, but this is an interesting test of the minority game model on real data.54
5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.
Table 1 gives a short overview of the design structures of some of the agent-based ﬁnancial market models
described in this paper. This is far from being an all inclusive list, since many of the models described in this
chapter would not ﬁt well into the criteria for the list. This emphasizes what should have become clear from
the earlier sections: agent-based ﬁnancial models have been built using many diﬀerent features and designs.

 ------------arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment.
This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism.
Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well",Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the criticisms of agent-based markets, highlighting the issues related to parameters, asset limitations, and detecting arbitrage opportunities with nonlinear strategies."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an important factor in determining results, especially in scenarios like delayed price adjustments in markets. The impact of timing decisions can be significant in a world of evolving strategies. The rationale for imposing time limits on complaint handling processes may not always be clear.","make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In
the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on
arbitrary timing decisions is deﬁnitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed
price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It
is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the

 There is no sound policy reason for the new time limit . 
 
At the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward 
by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate 
unmeritorious  or vexatious  claims being made14.  
 
The JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related 
to complaint handling  activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15. However, this 
recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a 
complaint16.  
 
Indeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the  
President’s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none 
of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for 
lodging a complaint.",Incorrect,"The answer does not directly address the question asked. It discusses the importance of timing in decision-making processes, but does not explain how timing can be an ignored final problem. Additionally, the response lacks clarity and coherence."

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces persists despite legislation prohibiting it since 1984. The current legislative scheme places the burden on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harassment. Victims must make a complaint before pursuing a remedy under the current system.,"Maurice Blackburn Lawyers submission to the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces .

i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful

 union officials, politicians, barristers and labour l awyers, to facilitate a discussion about the 
most effective legislative reforms to secure justice for victims of sexual harassment. These 
round table discussions allowed Maurice Blackburn to draw from the knowledge of other 
highly experienced professionals  working in employment law and industrial relations, in 
formulating this submission.  
 
These key themes are explored in more detail in the following pages. We also refer the 
AHRC to the joint statement submitted by over 100 organisations including Maurice 
Blackburn and the submission to this inquiry from Women Lawyers NSW, which addresses 
some of these matters in more detail (and with which representatives of Maurice Blackburn 
have been involved).

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by limiting the understanding of outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. Without sufficient data, it is challenging to assess the effectiveness of mediations and make informed decisions on improving the process. This lack of information hinders the ability to address issues and ensure a just result for complainants.","that statutory caps on damages under state legislation should be abolished to reflect the 
federal jurisdiction.

In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants.  
 
Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives.  
 
Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:

Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to

What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, as designated by the firm, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm. The firm believes there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace.

The impacts on victims can be life long and life changing.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the signif icant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail 
in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
We believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully 
aware of the incidence of sexual haras sment in their workplace, and that they should be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their 
reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’).

Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined",Correct,The student accurately identifies that one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm. The student also correctly mentions the firm's belief in enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace and the importance of reporting incidents of sexual harassment to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where there are particularly nefarious behaviors involved, and when individuals engage in threatening or harassing behavior through online platforms. It is important to hold not only the perpetrators accountable but also employers, social media platforms, and those who generate and distribute abusive material. Given the scope of online sexual harassment, a legislative framework should include both criminal sanctions and a civil process for victims to seek relief and damages."," The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who

 ------------engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material.  
 
We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.  
 
Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.",Correct,"The student provided a comprehensive answer outlining the criteria for criminalizing online sexual harassment, including nefarious behaviors, threatening or harassing behavior, accountability of perpetrators, employers, and social media platforms, as well as the need for a legislative framework encompassing criminal sanctions and civil process for victims."
