What is meant by 'investor heterogeneity'?,'Investor heterogeneity' refers to the diversity of agents or wealth distribution across different strategies in agent-based financial markets. This diversity leads to bounded rationality for both agents and modelers due to the complexity of the state space. Simplified rules of thumb are used by agents in response to this heterogeneity.,"from other more general heterogeneous agent models in ﬁnance, since the latter have been part of the ﬁeld
for some time.4In agent-based ﬁnancial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is
represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a ﬁxed or changing set of strategies. In
principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in
general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form
of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded
rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual
agents. It is also important to remember that the simpliﬁed rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest
that the exercise is forcing some sort of simpliﬁed solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,

What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?,"The revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century was characterized by the advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula.

In the mid to later part of the 20th century, ﬁnance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the eﬃcient
markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the
ﬁeld on a new, solid scientiﬁc foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were
powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders,
leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset
pricing, eﬃcient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing
to ﬁnancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to ﬁnancial practitioners.1It is interesting to note
that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large
machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for

 ------------(1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of ﬁrms and rational behavior in general. This powerful idea
still holds sway in much of the academic ﬁnancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein
(2001). As appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted
dynamical process describing how market eﬃciency comes about. The second foundation for eﬃcient market
theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization",Correct,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century, mentioning key developments such as the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula.

Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?,"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because key debates in finance about market efficiency and rationality remain unresolved. Additionally, financial time series contain puzzles that are not well understood, providing a wealth of data for analysis. These markets also offer a good approximation of fitness through wealth or return performance.","Financial markets are particularly appealing applications for agent-based methods for several reasons.
First, the key debates in ﬁnance about market eﬃciency and rationality are still unresolved. Second, ﬁnancial
time series contain many curious puzzles that are not well understood. Third, ﬁnancial markets provide a
wealth of pricing and volume data that can be analyzed. Fourth, when considering evolution, ﬁnancial
markets provide a good approximation to a crude ﬁtness measure through wealth or return performance.
Finally, there are strong connections to relevant experimental results that in some cases operate at the same
time scales as actual ﬁnancial markets.
Academic ﬁnance has debated the issue of market eﬃciency for some time. The concept of market

What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the types of securities to be traded, establishing fundamental values, and deciding on the scope of the economic environment to model.

The complexity of these design questions can make the process challenging, especially in crafting diverse and engaging worlds of heterogeneous agents.","for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.
Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of
securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there
an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very speciﬁc ﬁnancial market? As in any
economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,Lettau's framework involves a financial market model with heterogeneous learning agents making portfolio choices. The model includes a risky asset with a random dividend and a risk-free asset. Agents' preferences exhibit constant absolute risk aversion and are parameterized accordingly.,"Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement.
The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in
a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model
with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously
given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth
of agents is given by,
w=s(d−p), (2)
and their preferences are assumed to exhibit constant absolute risk aversion which can be parameterized as
in,
U(w) =−e−γw. (3)
This is clearly a very simpliﬁed market. No attempt is made to look at the feedback from agents’ demands

 ------------but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)

The use of mathematical formulae to explain the framework is missing, which could have enhanced the answer further."
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by the formula et=p1,t/p2,t. In equilibrium, the relative returns of the two currencies must be equal. The demand for savings can be calculated using the formula st=m1,t/p1,t+m2,t/p2,t=1/2(w1−w2)/Rt.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal.
Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.

 ------------continues to progress to higher ﬁtness levels.
Arifovic analyzes the dynamics of this market for various parameter values. The results show that the
ﬁrst-period consumption level converges to a stable value close to the optimum. However, the exchange rate
continues to move over time, never settling to any constant value. There is an interesting interpretation
for this dynamic price process. In the equilibrium the return on the two assets is the same, so the learning
agents are indiﬀerent between holding the two currencies. Groups of agents move to holding one currency or
another, the exchange rate moves around as they shift demands between currencies. In a model such as this,
it is clear that a constant exchange rate equilibrium can only be maintained through some mechanism that
shuts down learning and exploration in the model. Arifovic also shows that similar features are obtained in
experimental markets.30

Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters, with their impact not well understood. Critics also point out that there are too many degrees of freedom in these models, making validation challenging. Researchers can address these issues by replicating empirical features, controlling parameters evolutionarily, and utilizing results from experimental markets.","5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.
Table 1 gives a short overview of the design structures of some of the agent-based ﬁnancial market models
described in this paper. This is far from being an all inclusive list, since many of the models described in this
chapter would not ﬁt well into the criteria for the list. This emphasizes what should have become clear from
the earlier sections: agent-based ﬁnancial models have been built using many diﬀerent features and designs.

 ------------A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism
leveled at agent-based ﬁnancial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are
able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms
at their discretion in the attempt to ﬁt sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based ﬁnancial markets
must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all
experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the ﬁeld is moving that will give these markets
a more solid foundation.
Some steps that researchers can take to ameliorate these problems include replicating diﬃcult empirical
features, putting parameters under evolutionary control, and using results from experimental markets. The
ﬁrst of these suggestions involves making sure that an agent-based ﬁnancial market ﬁts facts which are not",Correct,"The answer provides a clear and concise discussion of the criticisms of agent-based markets, highlighting the issues of too many parameters, lack of understanding of their impact, and challenges in validation.

How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an ignored final problem because complaints are dealt with at an unsatisfactorily slow rate, causing complainants to feel fatigued and worn down by the process. Maurice Blackburn suggests amending the AHRC Act to set time frames for scheduling mediation conferences to address this issue and allow complaints to be resolved in a reasonable period of time. The current slow process hinders complainants from moving on with their lives and overcoming the trauma caused by harassing behavior.","is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
While we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in

 ------------events took place.  
 
The effect of this change is significant. While this time limit does not operate in the same way 
as a statutory limitation period does, the effect of a decision of the President to terminate the 
complaint is that a complainant loses access to the confident ial mediation process facilitated 
by the AHRC.  
 
The benefit of having access to the AHRC’s mediation process is that it allows victims of 
sexual harassment, whom typically have restricted access to the law, the opportunity to 
engage in a relatively low co st, less adversarial dispute resolution process.  
 
Maurice Blackburn submits the Amendment should be repealed and that the time for making 
complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law  jurisdictions.  
 
This submission is made fo r the following reasons : 
  
 There is no sound policy reason for imposing  the time period on complaints;

 ------------approach to mediation  should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at 
mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why timing is considered an ignored final problem, citing examples and suggesting solutions. It effectively addresses the question with relevant details."

their own strategies based on current performance. They draw rules from the common pool, comparing their

How do you think sexual harassment as an issue is peculiar to Australian workplaces?,Sexual harassment in Australian workplaces is a persistent issue despite legislation prohibiting it since 1984. The current legislative scheme places the burden on victims to seek redress rather than imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent harassment. Recommendations include enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace and exploring ways to combat online sexual harassment.,"Page 7 
  
i. Positive obligation on employers  
 
Sexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the 
Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth) (‘ SDA ’). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual 
harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation 
has failed in preventing this kind of conduct.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5.

 7. Recommendations to address sexual harassment in Australian workplaces.  
 
Maurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations:  
 
1. That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace -related 
sexual and sex -based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against 
employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
2. That AHRC should  consider ways that  employers can assist in creating a workplace 
where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not 
impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment.  
 
3. That AHRC  investigate  how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on -line 
sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented.  
 
4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on -line sexual 
harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools 
to allow them to:",Correct,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of how sexual harassment is peculiar to Australian workplaces, mentioning the legislative framework and recommendations for improvement."
What legislative suggestions pertaining to workplace sexual harassment does the firm provide in its submission?,"The firm suggests imposing a positive obligation on employers to prevent sexual harassment, authorizing WHS authorities to investigate and sanction breaches, and granting trade unions the authority to prosecute health and safety breaches. They also recommend requiring reporting of sexual harassment claims and statistics to the board of the defined entity and an external organization.","Submission in Response 
to the National Inquiry into 
Sexual Harassment in

 ------------Our s ubmission s in response to ToR 4:  
 
That the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable steps 
to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident  has occurred 
or not.  
 
That State and Territory WHS  authorities be explicitly authorised to investigate and impose 
sanctions on employers who have breached their duty to provide safe and without risk 
workplaces, particularly in the context of sexual harass ment.  
 
That State and Territory W HS authorities be appropriately resourced to investigat e and 
prosecute  risks to health and safety arising from sexual harassment.  
 
That trade unions be granted the authority  to prosecute for health and safety breaches

That the AHRC recommend a process for formally requiring that reporting of sexual

round table discussions allowed Maurice Blackburn to draw from the knowledge of other 
highly experienced professionals  working in employment law and industrial relations, in 
formulating this submission.  
 
These key themes are explored in more detail in the following pages. We also refer the 
AHRC to the joint statement submitted by over 100 organisations including Maurice

some of these matters in more detail (and with which representatives of Maurice Blackburn

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by limiting the understanding of outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. This lack of data hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of the mediation process in resolving complaints. Without sufficient data, it is challenging to make informed decisions and improvements to the Complaints Process.","complainants.  
 
Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives.  
 
Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process  
 
These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to

Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations affects the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It highlights the impact on understanding outcomes and assessing effectiveness, as well as the challenges in making informed decisions and improvements."
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,"One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme, according to Maurice Blackburn, is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for harm suffered, rather than obligating employers to prevent harm in the first place. They believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace. The current system requires victims to file a complaint with AHRC before pursuing a remedy, which can be burdensome without legal advice.","Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the signif icant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail 
in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
We believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully 
aware of the incidence of sexual haras sment in their workplace, and that they should be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their 
reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’).  
 
We believe that the current legislated tim eframe for making a complaint through AHRC is 
unworkable and out of step with other legislative provisions. It should be amended to 6 years

first instance.   
 
The current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of 
making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful 
harassment (‘ the Individual Complaint M odel’ )5.  
 
This means that an individual, who may (and often does) have limited access to the law, is 
obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the  AHRC , in order to seek redress. This 
process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without l egal advice. We will return to 
our concerns regarding the current system  in our discussion on the Complaints Process.",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of one significant failing of the current legislative scheme, which is the onus placed on victims to seek redress instead of obligating employers to prevent harm. It also suggests enforceable sanctions against employers for failing to provide a safe workplace. Additionally, it mentions the burden victims face in filing complaints with AHRC without legal advice."
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where individuals engage in particularly nefarious behaviors, and when employers, social media platforms, and those who generate and distribute abusive material are held accountable. A legislative framework should incorporate regulation and criminal sanctions to address online abuse, along with a civil regime for victims to seek relief and damages. It is important to provide individuals with legal tools to seek injunctive relief and damages from perpetrators and facilitators of online harassment.","This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material.  
 
We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.

 ------------line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.

 ------------We submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it  is 
important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:  
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual 
harassment , and 
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online  
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to  monitor and 
protect users.
