theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on ﬁnancial markets, is that markets are much more
unpredictable than the world of the ﬁnancial practitioner suggests.6In this early literature, the random
walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be
argued that the same holds true today. We know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable,
but they still are very diﬃcult to forecast.7
The early ideas of eﬃcient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization
were brought to bear on these problems.8This led to an even stronger representation for ﬁnancial markets,

individual who can then be linked to various state variables of the macroeconomy.

models. An example of this would be the explorations into decimalization on markets, or the implementation
of price limits. From a policy perspective this would seem to be a very natural place for the ﬁeld to move as
it matures.
Up to this point very little reference has been made to the growing literature on behavioral ﬁnance.
It is important to deﬁne where agent-based ﬁnancial markets sit relative to this larger ﬁeld. First, they

 ------------machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for
this new ﬁnancial rigor.2In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center
of a change in thinking about ﬁnancial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which
agents may diﬀer in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information,
their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.
Models in the realm of agent-based computational ﬁnance view ﬁnancial markets as interacting groups
of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand
the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would
be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3It is important to distinguish agent-based models
from other more general heterogeneous agent models in ﬁnance, since the latter have been part of the ﬁeld",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of why financial markets are appealing applications for agent-based methods.

What are the different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market?,"The different design questions in constructing an agent-based financial market include determining the economic environment, types of securities traded, and modeling the macro economy or specific financial markets. Crafting worlds of heterogeneous agents is complex, especially in agent-based models where knowledge of building representative agent macro economies may not directly apply. Market design and microstructure questions are well-suited for agent-based approaches due to the availability of data and the opportunity to address critical policy questions.","The remainder of this chapter will summarize recent work on agent-based computational models in
ﬁnance. The next section introduces some of the computational tools and design issues that are important
in building markets. Section 3 covers artiﬁcial market models that attempt to recreate an entire market.
Section 4 covers a few other types of markets which do not ﬁt into the earlier categories. Section 5 covers
some on-going debates and criticisms of agent-based markets, and section 6 concludes and suggests questions
for the future.
2 Design questions
In constructing an agent-based ﬁnancial market the researcher is faced with a large number of basic design
questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.
This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.

 ------------This section brieﬂy overviews most of these questions which will be seen again as the setup of diﬀerent
markets is covered in later parts of this survey.
Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of
securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there
an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very speciﬁc ﬁnancial market? As in any
economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often
more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous
agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building
representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design
question is probably the most important, and the most diﬃcult to give guidance on.
2.1 Preferences

 ------------4 Other markets
This sections covers several ﬁnancial market models which are diﬀerent from those considered above. Among
these are markets which consider detailed trading institutions and learning market makers, and also models
which consider the coevolution of strategies and ﬁnancial securities.
Most of the markets considered up to now have abstracted away from actual trading institutions. This
is somewhat of a puzzle in the agent-based ﬁnance world, since a bottom up approach would appear to call
for starting from the basics of how trades are executed. Most models build stylized economic structures that
avoid the institutional details of trading. However, research has begun appearing which implements more
realistic trading systems.48Market design and market microstructure questions appear to be well suited for
agent-based approaches. First, large amount of data are available. Second, there are critical policy questions

Discuss Lettau’s framework using various mathematical formulae.,"Lettau's framework involves agents using the optimal linear functional form for their portfolio, represented by si=αi(¯d−p). The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine the set of agent parameters, with agents parameterized using a bitstring encoding. The fitness value for each agent is estimated over S periods using Vi=S∑s=1U(wi,s).","but Lettau simpliﬁes this by using the optimal linear functional form for agent i,
si=αi(¯d−p). (7)
This gives the agents a head start on the portfolio problem, but they still need to learn the optimal α.28
The market is run for Speriods with new independent draws of the dividend for each period. Each agent
continues to use the portfolio determined by αi, which remains ﬁxed. At the end of each block of Sthe
genetic algorithm (GA) is run, and the set of agent parameters is redrawn. Agents are parameterized with
a bitstring encoding given by
αi=MIN + (MAX −MIN )∑L
j=1µj,i2j−1
2L−1(8)
where µj,iis the bitstring for the strategy of agent i. The GA ﬁrst gets a ﬁtness value for each agent estimated
over the Speriods using
Vi=S∑
s=1U(wi,s). (9)
This sets the ﬁtness to the ex post estimated expected utility over the sample. A new population is chosen
using a technique known as “ﬁtness proportional” selection. Each agent is assigned a probability using
pi=1/Vi∑J
j=1(1/Vj). (10)

problem given by,

when agents are able to learn this optimal portfolio strategy using a genetic algorithm. In general, agents’
policy functions could take the form of
s=s(¯d, p), (6)

 ------------3.2 Model dynamics under learning
The papers described in this section are more computational than those mentioned previously. In most
cases the small sets of tractable trading rules are replaced with larger sets of strategies, which are usually
represented using various computational techniques. These will be referred to as many-type models. This
ﬁrst section concentrates on applications where the economic environment is well understood and where there
is often a simple homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium which gives a useful benchmark comparison.
Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a ﬁnancial
market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement.
The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in
a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model",Correct,"The student has provided a clear explanation of Lettau's framework, including the optimal linear functional form for portfolios and the use of genetic algorithms to determine agent parameters. The student also correctly mentioned the fitness value estimation for each agent over S periods."
The exchange rate is given by what formula?,"The exchange rate is given by et=p1,t/p2,t. Agents' maximization problem yields demand for savings st=m1,t/p1,t+m2,t/p2,t=1/2(w1−w2)/Rt. The final exchange rate depends on the starting value in certain learning algorithms.","good, which has a price in each currency. The exchange rate is given by
et=p1,t
p2,t. (11)
Given this setup, all agents care about in terms of money holdings are the relative returns of the two
currencies. In an equilibrium where both currencies are held, these returns must be equal.
Rt=p1,t
p1,t+1=p2,t
p2,t+1. (12)
It is also easy to show that the agents’ maximization problem yields the following demand for savings:
st=m1,t
p1,t+m2,t
p2,t=1
2(w1−w21
Rt) (13)
The model has a fundamental indeterminacy in that, if there exists one price series and an exchange
rate paring that constitutes an equilibrium, then there will exist inﬁnitely many such equilibria. One of
the interesting issues that Arifovic is exploring is whether the GA learning mechanism will converge to a
single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.

 ------------single exchange rate. Sargent (1993) explored this same question; he found that certain learning algorithms
converge, but the ﬁnal exchange rate depends on the starting value.
The multi-agent model is set up with a population of agents in each generation. Agents are represented
with a bitstring which represents both their ﬁrst period consumption decision, and the fraction of their
savings to put into currency 1. A bitstring of length 30 is divided as 20 binary bits for consumption in
period 1, and 10 for the fraction of savings put into currency 1. These two values completely determine a
period 1 agent’s behavior through life. The price level in this model is determined endogenously. The agent
bitstings determine their desired real savings in each currency, which gives the aggregate demand for real
balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in

 ------------balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency. This setup avoids some of the complexities that appear in other papers in ﬁnding prices.
The evolution of strategies is similar to Lettau (1997). The ﬁtness of a strategy is determined by its
ex post utility, and a new population is drawn using ﬁtness proportional selection. Agents are paired, and
a crossover operator is applied to each pair with a given probability generating two new children. When
crossover is not used, the children are direct copies of the parents. These children are then mutated by
ﬂipping bits with a certain probability. The ﬁtness of the new rules is then estimated by implementing them
on the previous round of prices and returns. At this point all four of the children and parents are grouped
16

 ------------together, and the ﬁttest two of this set are put into the next generation’s population. This is known as
theelection operator , which was ﬁrst used in Arifovic (1994). It is designed to make sure that evolution
continues to progress to higher ﬁtness levels.
Arifovic analyzes the dynamics of this market for various parameter values. The results show that the
ﬁrst-period consumption level converges to a stable value close to the optimum. However, the exchange rate
continues to move over time, never settling to any constant value. There is an interesting interpretation
for this dynamic price process. In the equilibrium the return on the two assets is the same, so the learning
agents are indiﬀerent between holding the two currencies. Groups of agents move to holding one currency or
another, the exchange rate moves around as they shift demands between currencies. In a model such as this,
it is clear that a constant exchange rate equilibrium can only be maintained through some mechanism that",Incorrect,The answer provided is not relevant to the question asked. It includes information about agents' maximization problem and learning algorithms which are not related to the formula for calculating exchange rate.
Discuss the criticisms of agent-based markets.,"Agent-based markets have been criticized for having too many parameters, with the impact of many parameters not well understood. Another criticism is that these models often assume a small number of assets, limiting the complexity of the market. Additionally, there is a lack of general principles for constructing agent-based market models, which is a challenge that may improve as the field evolves.","numbers are, but this is an interesting test of the minority game model on real data.54
5 Cautions and criticisms
Agent-based markets have been criticized from many diﬀerent angles. The most common criticism is that the
models have far too many parameters, and the impact of many of these parameters is not well understood.
This issue has already been discussed in the section on calibration. However, beyond simple parameter
questions, these models have made use of a wide selection of the available computational tools and methods.
Table 1 gives a short overview of the design structures of some of the agent-based ﬁnancial market models
described in this paper. This is far from being an all inclusive list, since many of the models described in this
chapter would not ﬁt well into the criteria for the list. This emphasizes what should have become clear from
the earlier sections: agent-based ﬁnancial models have been built using many diﬀerent features and designs.

 ------------arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more
complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities. Arifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort
of issue, and ﬁnds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment.
This problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should
feel immune to this criticism.
Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based ﬁnancial market models assume a
small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55It is certainly
true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with
the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset. However, this simpliﬁcation may eliminate many
interesting features. The criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well

 ------------Unlike analytic models, there are still relatively few general principles that one can conﬁdently apply to the
construction of diﬀerent agent-based market models. This is a problem, but the situation should improve as
the ﬁeld evolves.
(Insert table 1 about here.)
Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based model’s results to the
addition of new trading strategies. Speciﬁcally, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns
in the data and change the dynamics? Agent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this
with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible. An initial
defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious
arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit. However, there is a possibility that more

questions that must be answered. Unfortunately, there is often little guidance on which direction to follow.

The response is well-structured and insightful."
How is timing an ignored final problem?,"Timing is an important factor in decision-making processes, especially in scenarios where events need to be sequenced clearly. Arbitrary timing decisions can significantly impact results, as seen in approaches like delayed price adjustments. In the context of sexual harassment complaints, setting specific time frames for mediation processes can help complainants receive timely resolution and move forward from the trauma they have experienced.","make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In
the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on
arbitrary timing decisions is deﬁnitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed
price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It
is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the

 There is no sound policy reason for the new time limit . 
 
At the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward 
by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate 
unmeritorious  or vexatious  claims being made14.  
 
The JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related 
to complaint handling  activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15. However, this 
recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a 
complaint16.  
 
Indeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the  
President’s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none 
of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for 
lodging a complaint.

 ------------mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.

 ------------complaint is that a complainant loses access to the confident ial mediation process facilitated 
by the AHRC.  
 
The benefit of having access to the AHRC’s mediation process is that it allows victims of 
sexual harassment, whom typically have restricted access to the law, the opportunity to 
engage in a relatively low co st, less adversarial dispute resolution process.  
 
Maurice Blackburn submits the Amendment should be repealed and that the time for making 
complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law  jurisdictions.  
 
This submission is made fo r the following reasons : 
  
 There is no sound policy reason for imposing  the time period on complaints;  
 
 A six -month time period is out of step with other Australian employment  law 
jurisdictions; and   
 
 Reducing access to an informal, low -cost dispute resolu tion process has a negative 
impact on the efficient resolution of complaints.  
 
These are elaborated upon below:",Incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address the question asked. It discusses the importance of timing in decision-making processes and sexual harassment complaints, but does not explain how timing can be an ignored final problem.

criterion is to use a forecast-based measure such as mean squared error, or mean absolute error, and to
promote rules that minimize this. Forecasts are then converted into asset demands using preferences. This

 ------------balances in the two currencies. Nominal currency supplies are given, so this determines the price level in
each currency. This setup avoids some of the complexities that appear in other papers in ﬁnding prices.
The evolution of strategies is similar to Lettau (1997). The ﬁtness of a strategy is determined by its
ex post utility, and a new population is drawn using ﬁtness proportional selection. Agents are paired, and
a crossover operator is applied to each pair with a given probability generating two new children. When
crossover is not used, the children are direct copies of the parents. These children are then mutated by
ﬂipping bits with a certain probability. The ﬁtness of the new rules is then estimated by implementing them
on the previous round of prices and returns. At this point all four of the children and parents are grouped

 ------------The theoretical parts of eﬃcient markets ideas have been attacked for quite some time. One of the most
important questions for market eﬃciency comes from Grossman & Stiglitz (1980). Here, agents have the
choice of purchasing an information signal on a ﬁnancial asset. In a perfectly eﬃcient world with a small
cost on the signal, no one would have an incentive to buy the signal. However, if no one bought the signal,
how did the market get informationally eﬃcient in the ﬁrst place? It is interesting to note that many of the
papers mentioned here, and in Hommes (2005), are based on the paradoxical structure of this model. More
recently, the literature on noise trading, [e. g., DeLong, Shleifer, Summers & Waldmann (1990)], introduced
the important idea that risk averse rational types may not be able to “take over” the dynamics from less
rational strategies, since they trade less aggressively because they are sensitive to the risk induced by the

 ------------adjustment level leads to increased volatility. Although interesting, this result does depend critically on very
speciﬁc behavioral assumptions made for the market maker.51
Most of the papers considered in this survey could loosely be considered part of the investment side of
ﬁnance. There is no consideration for the issuance of securities by ﬁrms, or the design and evolution of
securities themselves. A recent exception is Noe, Rebello & Wang (2003) which represents the ﬁrst paper to
consider corporate ﬁnance issues in an agent-based framework. The authors are interested in the problem of
which securities ﬁrms will issue to raise investment capital, and how investors learn to price these securities.
Firms need to issue securities that maximize their proﬁts, but cannot do this independent of investors’ pricing
strategies. On the other hand, investors must learn how to price and evaluate the securities issued by ﬁrms,",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how token gifts motivate the speakers by recognizing and appreciating their contributions.

Maurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations:  
 
1. That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace -related 
sexual and sex -based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against 
employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
2. That AHRC should  consider ways that  employers can assist in creating a workplace 
where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not 
impact an employee’s right to a safe work environment.

How does the scarcity of data on mediations impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process?,"The scarcity of data on mediations impacts the efficacy of the Complaints Process by limiting the understanding of outcomes in anti-discrimination and sexual harassment matters. This lack of data hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of the mediation process in resolving complaints. Without sufficient data, it is challenging to make informed decisions on improving the Complaints Process.","that statutory caps on damages under state legislation should be abolished to reflect the 
federal jurisdiction.  
 
vi. The Complaints Process  
 
In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants.  
 
Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives.  
 
Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process

These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined 
the outcomes of the mediation  process with respect to anti -discrimination matters, and 
even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to

 ------------mediation.  
 
Process after Complaint lodged  
 
Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation  process facilitated by the AHRC, 
is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.  
 
This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most 
instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3  and 1 2 months to have a 
complaint scheduled for mediation  and sometimes months to even have a matter 
allocated to a mediator . In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their 
lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma the y have suffered as a result of the 
harassing behaviour.  
 
In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act 
should be amended to expressly prescribe  time frames for the scheduling of mediation  
conferences. This would allo w complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a 
reasonable period of time.

 ------------complaint is that a complainant loses access to the confident ial mediation process facilitated 
by the AHRC.  
 
The benefit of having access to the AHRC’s mediation process is that it allows victims of 
sexual harassment, whom typically have restricted access to the law, the opportunity to 
engage in a relatively low co st, less adversarial dispute resolution process.  
 
Maurice Blackburn submits the Amendment should be repealed and that the time for making 
complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law  jurisdictions.  
 
This submission is made fo r the following reasons : 
  
 There is no sound policy reason for imposing  the time period on complaints;  
 
 A six -month time period is out of step with other Australian employment  law 
jurisdictions; and   
 
 Reducing access to an informal, low -cost dispute resolu tion process has a negative 
impact on the efficient resolution of complaints.  
 
These are elaborated upon below:",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the scarcity of data on mediations affects the efficacy of the Complaints Process. It highlights the impact on understanding outcomes and assessing effectiveness, as well as the challenge of making informed decisions without sufficient data."
What and why the firm designates as one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme?,One of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress rather than obligating employers to prevent harm. Maurice Blackburn believes there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace. The current legislative scheme has failed to prevent and address sexual harassment adequately.,"available to victims.  
 
The impacts on victims can be life long and life changing.  
 
Maurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the signif icant failings of the current legislative 
scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, 
rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the 
first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail 
in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.  
 
We believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully 
aware of the incidence of sexual haras sment in their workplace, and that they should be 
required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their 
reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’).  
 
We believe that the current legislated tim eframe for making a complaint through AHRC is

 ------------that statutory caps on damages under state legislation should be abolished to reflect the 
federal jurisdiction.  
 
vi. The Complaints Process  
 
In addition to the limitations of the statu tory framework set out above, from our experience, 
the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for 
complainants.  
 
Our primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that 
it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its 
statutory objectives.  
 
Below we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints 
Process. They are related to:  
 
 Scarcity of data on med iations;  
 Employer tactics ; and  
 The mediation process  
 
These are discussed in more detail below:  
 
Scarcity of Data  on Mediations  
 
It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined

 ------------ignored responsibilit y of safety regulators in each S tate and Territory  to investigate and 
prosecute breaches of health and safety legislation.  
 
In our view, it should be made abundantly clear, via legislative reform or through delegated 
legislation, that regulat ors are required to investigate sexual harassment complaints given 
the health and safety implications of same.  
 
We acknowledge that regulators are chronically understaffed and underfunded in many 
States and Territories and would encourage the establishmen t of a properly funded discrete 
directorate within WHS regulators aimed at investigating risks to health and safety arising 
from sexual harassment.  
 
In order to reduce the load on regulators, trade unions should also have the ability to 
prosecute for heal th and safety breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed.  
 
iii. Expanding company reporting requirements

 ------------are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career 
mobility are among the most vulnerable  groups6. 
 
Indeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally 
undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8. In the Fourth National 
Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces (‘ the Fourth Report’ ), the AHRC 
found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual  harassment in the 
workplace reported the behaviour9.  
 
That means that in 83 percent of cases, the victims did not make a complaint for a whole 
host of reasons. These statistics demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases the current 
legislative scheme  has both failed to prevent the conduct through deterrence, and has failed 
to address the conduct through providing victims with access to an adequate remedy.  
 
Under the current scheme, an employer’s obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent",Correct,"The answer provides a clear explanation of one significant failing of the current legislative scheme, which is the onus on victims to seek redress instead of obligating employers to prevent harm. It also suggests a solution by proposing enforceable sanctions against employers who fail to provide a safe workplace. Additionally, it mentions the inadequacy of the current scheme in preventing and addressing sexual harassment."
In what cases should online sexual harassment be criminalized according to the submission?,"Online sexual harassment should be criminalized in cases where individuals engage in particularly nefarious behaviors, causing harm to victims. This includes holding accountable not only the perpetrators but also employers and social media platforms that enable or expose individuals to such harassment. A legislative framework should provide legal tools for victims to seek relief and damages, ensuring that all parties involved in online sexual harassment are held responsible."," The perception that ‘the rules are different on -line’. Threats or harassment made on -
line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made 
via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around ‘online 
disinhibiti on’ is worthy of exploration.  
 
We have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates:  
 
 Regulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and 
carriage services to account, and  
 
 A civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal 
tools to allow them to seek relief and damages.  
 
This will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the 
relevant police and regulatory services with the res ources to successfully prosecute people 
engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who

 ------------engaging in sexual harassment through on -line platforms.  
 
We believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who 
cause, enable or expose people to on -line sexual harassmen t should be held to account, and 
this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and 
distribute the abusive material.  
 
We recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on -line sexual 
harassment, no regulat or or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in 
a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need 
for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve 
appropriate redress.  
 
Maurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil  / criminal legislative framework which 
could ensure:  
 
 That breache s, can be  investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, 
and failing that, the courts.

 ------------line sexual harassment  in Australia might be implemented.  
 
We submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it  is 
important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:  
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual 
harassment , and 
 
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online  
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to  monitor and 
protect users.  
 
 
2. The use of technology and social media to identify both alleged victims and 
perpetrators of workplace -related sexual harassment  
 
No response to this Term of Reference  
 
3. The drivers of workplace sexual harassment, including whether: some individuals 
are more likely to experience sexual harassment due to particular characteristics 
including gender, age, sexual orientation, culturally or linguistically diverse

 ------------sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented.  
 
4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on -line sexual 
harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools 
to allow them to:  
 Seek inj unctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on -line sexual 
harassment, and  
 Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online 
forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to 
monitor and prote ct users.  
 
5. That the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable 
steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident 
has occurred or not.  
 
6. That State and Territory WHS authorities be explicitly authorised to investigate and 
impose sanctions on employers who have breached their duty to provide safe and 
without risk workplaces, particularly in the context of sexual harassment.",Correct,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of when online sexual harassment should be criminalized, mentioning nefarious behaviors, harm to victims, accountability of perpetrators, employers, and social media platforms, legal tools for victims, and responsibility of all parties involved. The response is well-structured and covers all necessary aspects."
